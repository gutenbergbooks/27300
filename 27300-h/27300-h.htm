<h2>THE YOUNG ADVENTURER.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>MARK NELSON'S FAMILY.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I wish</span> I could pay off the mortgage on my
farm," said Mark Nelson soberly, taking his
seat on the left of the fireplace, in the room
where his wife and family were assembled.</p>

<p>"Have you paid the interest, Mark?" asked
his wife.</p>

<p>"Yes; I paid it this afternoon, and it has
stripped me of money completely. I have less
than five dollars in my pocketbook toward
buying you and the children clothes for the
winter."</p>

<p>"Never mind me," said his wife cheerfully.
"I am pretty well provided for."</p>

<p>"Why, mother," said Sarah, the oldest
daughter, a girl of fourteen; "you haven't had
a new dress for a year."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have enough to last me till spring, at
any rate," said the mother.</p>

<p>"You never buy anything for yourself."</p>

<p>"I don't go in rags, do I?" asked Mrs. Nelson,
with a smile.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson had a happy disposition, which
led her to accept uncomplainingly, and even
cheerfully, the sacrifices which, as the wife of
a farmer in poor circumstances, she was compelled
to make.</p>

<p>"You are right, Sarah," said Mark Nelson.
"Your mother never seems to think of
herself. She might have been much better off
if she had not married me."</p>

<p>The children did not understand this allusion.
They had never been told that their
mother had received an offer from Squire Hudson,
the wealthiest man in the village, but had
chosen instead to marry Mark Nelson, whose
only property was a small farm, mortgaged for
half its value. Her rejected admirer took the
refusal hard, for, as much as it was possible
for him, he loved the prettiest girl in the village,
as Mary Dale was generally regarded.
But Mary knew him to be cold and selfish,
and could not make up her mind to marry
him. If she had done so, she would now be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
living in the finest house in the village, with
the chance of spending the winter in New
York or Boston, instead of drudging in an
humble home, where there was indeed enough
to eat, but little money for even necessary purposes.
She had never regretted her decision.
Her husband, though poor, was generally respected
and liked, while the squire, though his
money procured him a certain degree of consideration,
had no near or attached friends.</p>

<p>To Squire Hudson many in the village paid
tribute; for he held mortgages on twenty
farms and buildings, and was strict in exacting
prompt payment of the interest semi-annually.
It was he to whom Mark Nelson's
farm was mortgaged for two thousand dollars.
The mortgage had originally been for fifteen
hundred dollars, but five years before it had
been increased to two thousand, which represented
more than half the sum which it would
have fetched, if put up for sale. The interest
on this sum amounted to a hundred and twenty
dollars a year, which Mark Nelson always
found it hard to raise. Could he have retained
it in his hands, and devoted it to the use of
his family, it would have helped them wonderfully,
with Mrs. Nelson's good management.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom, the oldest boy, now approaching his
sixteenth birthday, looked up from a book he
was reading. He was a bright-looking boy,
with brown hair, a ruddy complexion, and
dark-blue eyes, who looked, and was, frank
and manly.</p>

<p>"What is the amount of your interest?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Sixty dollars every half-year, Tom. That
is what I paid to Squire Hudson this afternoon.
It would have made us very comfortable,
if I only could have kept it."</p>

<p>"It would have done you more good than
the squire," said Sarah.</p>

<p>"He has more money than he knows what
to do with," said her father, almost complainingly.
"It seems hard that money should be
so unevenly distributed."</p>

<p>"Money is not happiness," said Mrs. Nelson
quietly.</p>

<p>"No; but it helps to buy happiness."</p>

<p>"I don't think Squire Hudson is as happy
a man as you, Mark."</p>

<p>Mark Nelson's face softened as he surveyed
his wife and children.</p>

<p>"I am happy at home," he said, "and I
don't think the squire is."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure he isn't," said Tom. "Mrs. Hudson
is sour and ill-tempered, and Sinclair&mdash;the
only child&mdash;is a second edition of his
mother. He is the most unpopular boy in the
village."</p>

<p>"Still," said the farmer, not quite convinced,
"money is an important element of
happiness, and a farmer stands a very poor
chance of acquiring it. Tom, I advise you not
to be a farmer."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to be if I can help it," said
Tom. "I am ready for any opening that offers.
I hope some day to pay off the mortgage on the
farm, and make you a free man, father."</p>

<p>"Thank you for your good intentions, Tom;
but two thousand dollars is a large sum of
money."</p>

<p>"I know it, father; but I was reading in a
daily paper, not long since, of a boy, as poor
as myself, who was worth twenty-five thousand
dollars by the time he was thirty. Why
shouldn't this happen to me?"</p>

<p>"Don't build castles in the air, Tom," said
his mother sensibly.</p>

<p>"At least, mother, I may hope for good luck.
I have been wanting to talk to you both about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
my future prospects. I shall be sixteen next
week, and it is time I did something."</p>

<p>"You are doing something&mdash;working on the
farm now, Tom."</p>

<p>"That don't count. Father advises me not
to be a farmer, and I agree with him. I think
I am capable of making my way in the world
in some other way, where I can earn more
money. There is Walter, who likes the
country, to stay with you."</p>

<p>Walter, the third child, was now twelve
years of age, with decided country tastes.</p>

<p>"I would like to be a farmer as well as
anything," said Walter. "I like the fresh air.
I shouldn't like to be cooped up in a store, or
to live in the city. Let Tom go if he likes."</p>

<p>"I have no objection," said Mr. Nelson;
"but I have neither money nor influence to
help him. He will have to make his own way."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid to try," said Tom courageously.
"From this day I will look out for a
chance, if you and mother are willing."</p>

<p>"I shall not oppose your wishes, Tom," said
Mrs. Nelson gravely, "though it will be a sad
day for me when you leave your home."</p>

<p>"That isn't the way to look at it, mother,"
said Tom. "If gold pieces grew on currant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
bushes, it wouldn't be necessary for me to
leave home to make a living."</p>

<p>"I wish they did," said Harry, a boy nine
years of age.</p>

<p>"What would you do then, Harry?" asked
his brother, smiling.</p>

<p>"I would buy a velocipede and a pair of
skates."</p>

<p>"I heard of a boy once who found a penny
in the field, right under a potato-vine," said
Walter.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Harry.</p>

<p>"It's true, for I was the boy."</p>

<p>"Where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"Tom put it there to fool me."</p>

<p>"Won't you put one there to fool me,
Tom?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"You are too smart, Harry," said Tom,
laughing. "My pennies are too few to try such
experiments. I hope, by the time you are as
old as Walter, to give you something better."</p>

<p>The conversation drifted to other topics,
with which we are not concerned. Tom, however,
did not forget it. He felt that an important
question had that evening been decided
for him. He had only thought of making
a start for himself hitherto. Now he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
broached the subject, and received the permission
of his father and mother. The world was
all before him where to choose. His available
capital was small, it is true, amounting
only to thirty-seven cents and a jack-knife;
but he had, besides, a stout heart, a pair of
strong hands, an honest face, and plenty of
perseverance&mdash;not a bad equipment for a
young adventurer.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>TOM FINDS A WALLET.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the time of which I am writing, over
sixty years have passed, for it was in the year
1850 that Tom made up his mind to leave home
and seek a fortune. The papers were full of
the new gold discoveries in the new country
which had recently been added to the great republic.
Thousands were hurrying to the land
of gold; men who had been unfortunate at
home, or, though moderately well situated,
were seized by the spirit of adventure. At considerable
sacrifice many raised the means of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
reaching the new El Dorado, while others borrowed
or appropriated the necessary sum.
Some, able to do neither, set out on a venture,
determined to get there in some way.</p>

<p>In the weekly paper, to which Mr. Nelson
had for years been a subscriber, Tom had
read a good deal about California. His youthful
fancy had been wrought upon by the brilliant
pictures of a land where a penniless man
might, if favored by fortune, secure a competence
in a twelvemonth, and he ardently
wished that he, too, might have the chance of
going there. It was a wish, but not an expectation.
It would cost at least two hundred
dollars to reach the Pacific coast, and there was
no hope of getting a tithe of that sum.</p>

<p>"If I could only go to California," thought
Tom, "I would make my way somehow; I
would cheerfully work twelve hours a day. I
don't see why a boy can't dig gold, as well as
a man. If somebody would lend me money
enough to get there, I could afford to pay high
interest."</p>

<p>There was one man in Wilton who might
lend him the money if he would. That man
was Squire Hudson. He always had money on
hand in considerable quantities, and two hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
dollars would be nothing to him. Tom
would not have dreamed of applying to him,
however, but for a service which just at this
time he was able to render the squire.</p>

<p>Tom had been in search of huckleberries&mdash;for
this was the season&mdash;when, in a narrow
country road, not much frequented, his attention
was drawn to an object lying in the road.
His heart hounded with excitement when he
saw that it was a well-filled pocketbook. He
was not long in securing it.</p>

<p>Opening the wallet, he found it was absolutely
stuffed with bank-bills, some of large
denomination. There were, besides, several
papers, to which he paid but little attention.
They assured him, however, as he had already
surmised, that the wallet was the property of
Squire Hudson.</p>

<p>"I wonder how much money there is here,"
thought Tom, with natural curiosity.</p>

<p>He stepped into the woods to avoid notice,
and carefully counted the bills. There were
two hundred-dollar bills, and three fifties,
and so many of smaller denominations that
Tom found the whole to amount to five hundred
and sixty-seven dollars.</p>

<p>"Almost six hundred dollars!" ejaculated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Tom, in excitement, for he had never seen so
much money before. "How happy should I
be if I had as much money! How rich the
squire is! He ought to be a happy man."</p>

<p>Then the thought stole into our hero's mind,
that the wallet contained nearly three times
as much as he would need to take him to California.</p>

<p>"If it were only mine!" he thought to himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps Tom ought to have been above
temptation, but he was not. For one little instant
he was tempted to take out two hundred
dollars, and then drop the wallet where he had
picked it up. No one would probably find out
where the missing money was. But Tom had
been too well brought up to yield to this
temptation. Not even the thought that he
might, perhaps within a year, return the money
with interest, prevailed upon him.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be honest," he decided, "and
if I began in that way I could not expect that
God would prosper me. If that is the only way
by which I can go to California I must make
up my mind to stay at home."</p>

<p>So the question was settled in Tom's mind.
The money must be returned to the owner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
His pail was nearly full of huckleberries, but
he postponed going home, for he felt that
Squire Hudson would be feeling anxious about
his loss, and he thought it his duty to go and
return the money first of all. Accordingly he
made his way directly to the imposing residence
of the rich man.</p>

<p>Passing up the walk which led to the front
door, Tom rang the bell. This was answered
by a cross-looking servant. She glanced at
the pail of berries, and said quickly: "We
don't want any berries, and if we did you ought
to go round to the side door."</p>

<p>"I haven't asked you to buy any berries,
have I?" said Tom, rather provoked by the
rudeness of the girl, when he had come to do
the squire a favor.</p>

<p>"No, but that's what you're after. We have
bought all we want."</p>

<p>"I tell you I didn't come here to sell berries,"
said Tom independently; "I picked these
for use at home."</p>

<p>"Then what do you come here for, anyway,
takin' up my time wid comin' to the door,
when I'm busy gettin' supper?"</p>

<p>"I want to see Squire Hudson."</p>

<p>"I don't know if he's at home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you'd better find out, and not keep
me waiting."</p>

<p>"I never see such impudence," ejaculated
the girl.</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," continued Tom
stoutly. "I want to see the squire on important
business."</p>

<p>"Much business you have wid him!" said
the girl scornfully.</p>

<p>Tom by this time was out of patience.</p>

<p>"Go and tell your master that I wish to see
him," he said firmly.</p>

<p>"I've a great mind to slam the door in
your face," returned Bridget angrily.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't advise you to," said Tom calmly.</p>

<p>A stop was put to the contention by an irritable
voice.</p>

<p>"What's all this, hey? Who's at the door,
Bridget?"</p>

<p>"A boy wid berries, sir."</p>

<p>"Tell him I don't want any."</p>

<p>"I have told him, and he won't go."</p>

<p>"Won't go, hey?" and Squire Hudson came
out into the hall. "What's all this, I say?
Won't go?"</p>

<p>"I wish to see you, sir," said Tom, undaunted.
"I have told the girl that I didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
come here to sell berries; but she objects to my
seeing you."</p>

<p>Squire Hudson was far from an amiable
man, and this explanation made him angry
with the servant. He turned upon her
fiercely.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you trollop," he demanded,
"by refusing to let the boy see me?
What do you mean by your insolence, I say?"</p>

<p>Bridget was overwhelmed, for the squire's
temper was like a tornado.</p>

<p>"I thought he wanted to sell berries," she
faltered.</p>

<p>"That isn't true," said Tom. "I told you
expressly that I picked the berries for use at
home, and had none to sell."</p>

<p>"Go back to the kitchen, you trollop!"
thundered the squire. "You deserve to go to
jail for your outrageous conduct."</p>

<p>Bridget did not venture to answer a word,
for it would only have raised a more violent
storm, but retreated crestfallen to her own
realm, and left our hero in possession of the
field. She contented herself with muttering
under her breath what she did not dare to
speak aloud.</p>

<p>"You are Tom Nelson, are you not?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the squire, adjusting his spectacles, and looking
more carefully at the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you any message from your father?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then why did you come here to take up
my time?" demanded the squire, frowning.</p>

<p>"I came to do you a service, Squire Hudson."</p>

<p>"You came&mdash;to&mdash;do&mdash;me&mdash;a&mdash;service?" repeated
the squire slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You may as well come in," said the rich
man, leading into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Tom followed him into a handsomely furnished
room, and the two sat down opposite
each other.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>TOM ASKS A LOAN.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I don't</span> know what service you can do
me," said Squire Hudson incredulously.</p>

<p>His manner implied: "I am a rich man and
you are a poor boy. How can you possibly
serve me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you lost anything lately?" inquired
Tom, coming at once to business.</p>

<p>I suppose most men, when asked such a
question, would first think of their pocket-books.
It was so with Squire Hudson. He
hastily thrust his hand into his pocket, and
found&mdash;a large hole, through which, doubtless,
the wallet had slipped.</p>

<p>"I have lost my wallet," he said anxiously.
"Have you found it?"</p>

<p>In reply Tom produced the missing article.
The squire took it hurriedly, and, at once opening
it, counted the money. It was all there,
and he heaved a sigh of relief, for he was a
man who cared for money more than most people.</p>

<p>"Where did you find it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Tom answered the question.</p>

<p>"It is very fortunate you came along before
anyone else saw it. I rode that way on horse-back
this morning. I told Mrs. Hudson that
my pocket needed repairing, but she put it
off, according to her usual custom. If it had
not been found, I would have kept her on short
allowance for a year to come."</p>

<p>Tom felt rather embarrassed, for, of course,
it would not do to join in with the squire in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
his complaints of his wife. Suddenly Squire
Hudson said, eying him keenly: "Do you
know how much money there is in this wallet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you counted it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to know how much there was, so
that no one might blame me if any were missing."</p>

<p>"Didn't you want to take any?" asked the
squire bluntly.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Tom promptly.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you? For fear you would be
found out?"</p>

<p>"That may have had something to do with
it, but it was principally because it would have
been stealing and stealing is wrong."</p>

<p>"What would you have done with the money
if you had taken it?"</p>

<p>"Started for California next week," answered
Tom directly.</p>

<p>"Eh?" ejaculated the squire, rather astonished.
"Why do you want to go to California&mdash;a
boy like you?"</p>

<p>"To dig gold. I suppose a boy can dig gold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
as well as a man. There doesn't seem to be
much chance for me here. There's nothing to
do but to work on the farm, and father and
Walter can do all there is to be done there."</p>

<p>"How is your father getting along?" asked
the rich man, with an interest which rather
surprised Tom.</p>

<p>"Poorly," said Tom. "He makes both ends
meet; but we all have to do without a great
many things that we need."</p>

<p>The squire looked thoughtful. He took half
a dollar from his wallet and tendered it to
Tom.</p>

<p>"You've done me a service," he said. "Take
that."</p>

<p>Tom drew back.</p>

<p>"I would rather not take money for being
honest," he said.</p>

<p>"That's all nonsense," said Squire Hudson
sharply.</p>

<p>"That's the way I feel about it," said Tom
stoutly.</p>

<p>"Then you're a fool."</p>

<p>"I hope not, sir."</p>

<p>"This would have been quite a large loss
to me. I am perfectly willing to give you this
money."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Tom gathered courage and said boldly,
"You can do me a great favor, Squire Hudson,
if you choose."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Lend me enough money to go to California,"
said Tom nervously.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! Is the boy crazy?" ejaculated
the astonished squire.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I am not crazy. I'll tell you what
my plans are. I shall go to work directly I
get there, and shall devote the first money I
make to paying you. Of course, I shall expect
to pay high interest. I am willing to pay you
three hundred dollars for two; unless I am
sick, I think I can do it inside of twelve
months."</p>

<p>"How much money do you suppose you will
need for this wild-goose expedition?"</p>

<p>"About two hundred dollars, sir; and, as
I just said, I will give you my note for three."</p>

<p>"A boy's note is worth nothing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it isn't in law; but I wouldn't rest
till it was paid back."</p>

<p>"What security have you to offer?"</p>

<p>"None, sir, except my word."</p>

<p>"Do you know what I would be if I lent
you this money?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would be very kind."</p>

<p>"Pish! I should be a fool."</p>

<p>"I don't think you'd lose anything by it, sir;
but, of course, I can't blame you for refusing,"
and Tom rose to go.</p>

<p>"Sit down again," said the squire; "I want
to talk to you about this matter. How long
have you been thinking of California?"</p>

<p>"Only two or three days, sir."</p>

<p>"What made you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to help father."</p>

<p>"Who has told you about California?"</p>

<p>"I have read about it in the papers."</p>

<p>"Have you spoken to your father about
going there?"</p>

<p>"I have spoken to him about leaving home,
and seeking my fortune; but I have not mentioned
going to California, because I thought
it impossible to raise the necessary money."</p>

<p>"Of course. That's sensible, at least."</p>

<p>Squire Hudson rose and walked thoughtfully
about the room, occasionally casting a
keen glance at Tom, who remained sitting,
with his pail of huckleberries in his cap.</p>

<p>After a while the squire spoke again.</p>

<p>"Your father might let you have the
money," he suggested.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"My father has no money to spare," said
Tom quickly.</p>

<p>"Couldn't he raise some?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you. I hold a mortgage for
two thousand dollars on his farm. I suppose
you know that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I might be willing to increase the mortgage
to twenty-two hundred, and he could lend you
the extra two hundred."</p>

<p>This was a new idea to Tom, and he took a
little time to think it over.</p>

<p>"I don't like to ask father to do that," he
said. "He finds it very hard now to pay the
interest on the mortgage."</p>

<p>"I thought you intended to pay the money
in a year," said the squire sharply.</p>

<p>"So I do," said Tom, and he began to think
more favorably of the plan.</p>

<p>"In that case your father wouldn't suffer."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir. If father would only
consent to do so, I would be happy. But I
might die."</p>

<p>"Your father would have to take the risk of
that. You can't expect me to."</p>

<p>This seemed fair enough, and, in fact, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
danger didn't seem very great to Tom. He was
about sixteen; and to a boy of sixteen death
seems very far off, provided he is strong and
vigorous, as Tom was. He rapidly decided
that the squire's offer was not to be refused
without careful consideration. It opened to
him a career which looked bright and promising.
Once in California, what could he not
do? Tom was hopeful and sanguine, and did
not allow himself to think of failure.</p>

<p>"I understand that you are willing to advance
the money, Squire Hudson?" he said,
determined to know just what to depend upon.</p>

<p>"I will advance two hundred dollars, on condition
that your father will secure me by an
increased mortgage. It is no particular object
to me, for I can readily invest the money in
some other way."</p>

<p>"I will speak to father about it, Squire Hudson,
and meanwhile I am thankful to you for
making the offer."</p>

<p>"Very well. Let me know as soon as possible,"
said the squire carelessly.</p>

<p>As Tom went out, the rich man soliloquized:
"I have no faith in the boy's scheme, and I
don't believe half the stories they tell about the
California mines; but it will give me an extra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hold on Nelson, and hasten the day when the
farm will come into my hands. When Mary
Nelson refused my hand I resolved some day
to have my revenge. I have waited long, but it
will come at last. When she and her children
are paupers, she may regret the slight she put
upon me."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>TOM ASKS LEAVE OF ABSENCE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> walked home slowly, but the distance
seemed short, for he was absorbed in thought.
In a way very unexpected he seemed to be
likely to realize what he had regarded as a
very pleasant, but impossible, dream. Would
his father consent to the squire's proposal,
and, if so, ought Tom to consent to expose him
to the risk of losing so considerable a sum of
money? If he had been older and more cautious
he would probably have decided in the
negative; but Tom was hopeful and sanguine,
and the stories he had heard of California had
dazzled him. There was, of course, an element
of uncertainty in his calculations, but the fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that there seemed to be no prospect before him
in his native village had an important influence
in shaping his decision.</p>

<p>To ask his father the momentous question,
however, was not easy, and he delayed it, hoping
for a favorable opportunity of introducing
the subject. His thoughtful manner excited
attention, and secured him the opportunity
he sought.</p>

<p>"You seem deep in thought, Tom," said his
mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I have a good deal to think
about."</p>

<p>"Anybody would think Tom overwhelmed
with business," said Walter, next to Tom in
age, with good-humored banter.</p>

<p>"I am," said Tom gravely.</p>

<p>"Won't you take me in partnership, then?"
asked Walter.</p>

<p>Tom smiled.</p>

<p>"I don't think I could do that," he answered.
"Not to keep you waiting, Squire
Hudson has made me a business proposal this
afternoon."</p>

<p>All were surprised and looked to Tom for an
explanation.</p>

<p>"He offers to advance me two hundred dollars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
for a year, to help me out to California."</p>

<p>"Squire Hudson makes this offer to a boy
of your age?" said his father slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, or rather he makes the offer to you."</p>

<p>"To me?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will think me selfish for even
mentioning it," said Tom rapidly, in a hurry
to explain fully now that the ice was broken.
"He will advance the money, on condition that
you increase the mortgage on the farm to
twenty-two hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson looked blank.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Tom," he said, "how hard I
find it now to pay the interest on the mortgage,
and how hopeless I am of ever paying it off?"</p>

<p>"I know all that, father; but I want to help
you. If I keep my health, and have a chance,
I think I can help you. There's no chance for
me here, and there is a chance in California.
You remember what we have read in the
<i>Weekly Messenger</i> about the gold-fields, and
what large sums have been realized by miners."</p>

<p>"They are men, and you are a boy."</p>

<p>"That's true," said Tom, "but," he added,
with natural pride, "I am pretty strong for
a boy. I am willing to work, and I don't see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
why I can't dig gold as well as a man. I may
not make as much, but if I only do half as
well as some that we have read about, I can do
a good deal for you."</p>

<p>"How far off is California?" asked Mrs.
Nelson.</p>

<p>"Over three thousand miles, across the continent,"
answered her husband. "By sea it is
a good deal more."</p>

<p>"Why, it is as far off as Europe," said
Walter, who was fresh from his lesson in geography.</p>

<p>"It is farther than some parts of Europe&mdash;England,
for example," said his father.</p>

<p>"And a wild, unsettled region," said Mrs.
Nelson soberly.</p>

<p>"I don't think so much of that," said Mark
Nelson. "Tom is no baby. He is a boy of
good sense, not heedless, like some of his age,
and I should feel considerable confidence in his
getting along well."</p>

<p>"What, Mark, are you in favor of his going
so far&mdash;a boy who has never been away from
home in his life?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say. I have not had
time to consider the matter, as it has come upon
me suddenly. I have a good deal of confidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in Tom, but there is one difficulty in
my mind."</p>

<p>"What is that, father?" asked Tom anxiously.</p>

<p>"The expense of getting to California, and
the method of raising the money; I don't like
to increase the mortgage."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right, father," said Tom
slowly. "I know it is more than I have any
right to ask. I wouldn't even have mentioned
it if I hadn't hoped to help you to pay it back."</p>

<p>"That is understood, Tom," said his father
kindly. "I know you mean what you say, and
that you would redeem your promise if fortune,
or rather Providence, permitted. It is a
serious matter, however, and not to be decided
in a hurry. We will speak of it again."</p>

<p>Nothing more was said about Tom's plan till
after the children had gone to bed. Then, as
Mark Nelson and his wife sat before the fire
in the open fireplace, the subject was taken up
anew.</p>

<p>"Mary," said Mark, "I am beginning to
think favorably of Tom's proposal."</p>

<p>"How can you say so, Mark?" interrupted
his wife. "It seems like madness to send a
young boy so far away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tom can't be called a young boy; he is now
sixteen."</p>

<p>"But he has never been away from home."</p>

<p>"He must go some time."</p>

<p>"If it were only to Boston or New York;
but to go more than three thousand miles
away!" and the mother shuddered.</p>

<p>"There are dangers as great in Boston or
New York as in California, Mary, to a boy of
Tom's age. He can't always be surrounded by
home influences."</p>

<p>"I wish we could find employment for him
in town," said Mrs. Nelson uneasily.</p>

<p>"That is a mother's thought, and it would
be pleasant for all of us; but I doubt if it
would be better for Tom."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"A boy who is thrown upon his own guardianship
and his own resources develops manliness
and self-reliance sooner than at home.
But we need not take that into consideration;
there is nothing to do here, nor is there likely
to be. He must go away from home to find
employment. To obtain a place in Boston or
New York requires influence and friends in
those places; and we can hope for neither. In
California he will become his own employer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
The gold-mines are open to all, and he may
earn in a year as much as he could in five
years in the East."</p>

<p>"Do you favor his going, then, Mark?"</p>

<p>"Not against your will, Mary. Indeed, I
should not feel justified in increasing the mortgage
upon our little property against your
wish. That concerns us all."</p>

<p>"I don't think so much of that. I am so
afraid Tom would get sick in California.
What would become of the poor boy in that
case?"</p>

<p>"That is a mother's thought. I think Tom
would find friends, who would not let him
suffer. He is a manly, attractive boy, though
he is ours, and I think he is well calculated
to make his way."</p>

<p>"That he is," said his mother proudly.
"No one can help liking Tom."</p>

<p>"Then you see he is likely to find friends.
Were he such a boy as Sinclair Hudson, I
should feel afraid that he would fare badly,
if he stood in need of help from others. Sinclair
is certainly a very disagreeable boy."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is; and he isn't half as smart as
Tom."</p>

<p>"A mother's vanity," said Mark Nelson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
smiling. "However, you are right there. I
should consider it a misfortune to have such
a cross-grained, selfish son as Sinclair. Squire
Hudson, with all his wealth, is not fortunate
in his only child. There is considerable resemblance
between father and son. I often
wish that some one else than the squire held
the mortgage on our farm."</p>

<p>"You don't think he would take advantage
of you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he would be very lenient to
me if I failed to pay interest promptly. He
has a grudge against me, you know."</p>

<p>"That is nonsense," said Mrs. Nelson,
blushing, for she understood the allusion.</p>

<p>"I am glad he doesn't ask me to give him a
mortgage on you, Mary."</p>

<p>"He has forgotten all that," said Mrs. Nelson.
"I am no longer young and pretty."</p>

<p>"I think you more attractive than ever,"
said the husband.</p>

<p>"Because you are foolish," said his wife;
but she was well pleased, nevertheless. Poor
as her husband was, she had never dreamed of
regretting her choice.</p>

<p>"Be it so; but about this affair of Tom&mdash;what
shall I say to him in the morning?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson recovered her gravity instantly.</p>

<p>"Decide as you think right, Mark," she
said. "If you judge that Tom had better go
I will do my best to become reconciled to his
absence, and set about getting him ready."</p>

<p>"It is a great responsibility, Mary," said
Mark slowly; "but I accept it. Let the boy
go, if he wishes. He will leave our care, but
we can trust him to the care of his heavenly
Father, who will be as near to him in California
as at home."</p>

<p>Thus Tom's future was decided. His father
and mother retired to bed, but not to sleep.
They were parting already in imagination
with their first-born, and the thought of that
parting was sad indeed.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>TOM RAISES THE MONEY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> got up early the next morning&mdash;in
fact, he was up first in the house&mdash;and attended
to his usual "chores." He was splitting
wood when his father passed him on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
way to the barn with the milk-pail in his
hand.</p>

<p>"You are up early, Tom," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered our hero.</p>

<p>Tom could not help wondering whether his
father had come to any decision about letting
him go to California; but he did not like to
ask. In due time he would learn, of course.
He felt that he should like to have it decided
one way or the other. While his plans were
in doubt he felt unsettled and nervous.</p>

<p>At an early hour the family gathered about
the breakfast table. Tom noticed that his
father and mother looked grave, and spoke
in a subdued tone, as if they had something on
their minds; but he did not know what to infer
from this, except that they had his prospects
still in consideration.</p>

<p>When breakfast was over, Mark Nelson
pushed back his chair, and said: "How soon
can you get Tom ready to start, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Am I going, father?" asked Tom, his
heart giving an eager bound.</p>

<p>"Is Tom really going?" asked the younger
children, with scarcely less eagerness.</p>

<p>"If Squire Hudson doesn't go back on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
promise. Tom, you can go with me to the
squire's."</p>

<p>"How soon?"</p>

<p>"In about an hour. He doesn't breakfast
as early as we do. I think he will be ready
to receive us in about an hour."</p>

<p>"Thank you, father," said Tom. "You are
doing a great deal for me."</p>

<p>"I can't do much for you, my boy. I can
probably get you to California, and then you
will be thrown upon your own exertions."</p>

<p>"I mean to work very hard. I think I shall
succeed."</p>

<p>"I hope so, at least, Tom. When the time
comes to start the other boys, I shall be glad
to have your help in doing it."</p>

<p>Tom was pleased to hear this, though it
placed upon his shoulders a new and heavy
responsibility. He was assuming the responsibility
not only for his own future, but for that
of his brothers. But it made him feel more
manly, as if the period of his dependent boyhood
were over, and he had become a young
man all at once.</p>

<p>"I hope I sha'n't disappoint you, father,"
he said.</p>

<p>"If you do, I don't think it will be your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
fault, Tom," said his father kindly. "Fortune
may be against you, but we must take the risk
of that."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think about it, Tom,"
said his mother, in a tone of doubt and mental
disturbance. "I feel as if you were too young
to go out in the wide world to seek your fortune."</p>

<p>"I am not so very young, mother. I am
old enough to make my way."</p>

<p>"So your father says, and I have yielded to
his judgment; but, Tom, I don't know how to
let you go."</p>

<p>There were tears in Mrs. Nelson's eyes as
she spoke. Tom was moved, and if he needed
anything to strengthen him in the good resolutions
he had formed, his mother's emotion supplied
it.</p>

<p>"You sha'n't regret giving your consent,
mother," he said manfully, and, rising from
his seat, he went to his mother and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Mary," said Mr. Nelson, "you haven't
answered my question. How long will it take
to get Tom ready? If he is to go, he may as
well start as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Mrs. Nelson, "how many
shirts have you got, Tom?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Five."</p>

<p>"Are they all in good order?"</p>

<p>"I believe one needs mending."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether that will be enough,"
said Mrs. Nelson doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Mary," said her husband, "don't provide
too large a supply of clothing. Tom may find
it a burden. Remember, in California, he will
have to travel on foot and carry his own baggage."</p>

<p>"Then I think he is already pretty well provided.
But some of his clothes may need
mending. That won't take long, and I will
attend to it at once."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Squire Hudson will go back on
you, after all," said Walter.</p>

<p>Tom's face was overcast. That would be a
disappointment he could not easily bear.</p>

<p>"I shall soon know," he said.</p>

<p>An hour later Tom and his father set out for
Squire Hudson's residence. Tom felt nervous;
he could not well help it.</p>

<p>"Tom," said his father, "this is an important
visit for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"You are feeling nervous, I see. Try to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
take it coolly, and don't feel too low-spirited
if things don't turn out as you hope."</p>

<p>"I will try to follow your advice, father,
but I am not sure as I can."</p>

<p>"If you are disappointed, try to think it is
for the best. A boy of your age had made all
arrangements to visit Europe with a party of
friends. The day before starting something
happened which made it impossible for him to
go. For weeks he had been looking forward
with eager anticipation to his journey, and
now it was indefinitely postponed."</p>

<p>"What a terrible disappointment!" said
Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, it seemed so, but mark the issue. The
steamer was lost, and all on board were
drowned. The disappointment saved his life."</p>

<p>"It might not always turn out so," objected
Tom.</p>

<p>"No, that is true. Still, if we are willing
to think that our disappointments are not
always misfortunes, we shall go through life
with more cheerfulness and content."</p>

<p>"Still, I hope I shall not be disappointed
in this," said Tom.</p>

<p>"You are perhaps too young to be philosophical,"
said his father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark Nelson had enjoyed only the usual
advantages of education afforded by a common
school; but he was a man of good natural
capacity, and more thoughtful than many in
his vocation. From him Tom inherited good
natural abilities and industrious habits. It
would not be fair, however, to give all the
credit to his father. Mrs. Nelson was a superior
woman, and all her children were well
endowed by nature.</p>

<p>As they turned into Squire Hudson's gravel-path,
the squire himself opened the front
door.</p>

<p>"Were you coming to see me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We would like to speak with you a few
minutes, squire, if you can spare the time."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have nothing pressing on hand,"
said the squire, with unusual affability.
"Walk in, Mr. Nelson."</p>

<p>He led the way into the room where Tom
had had his interview with him the day before.</p>

<p>"Your son did me a good turn yesterday,"
he said graciously. "He behaved in a very
creditable manner."</p>

<p>"He told me that he found your pocketbook,
Squire Hudson."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; it contained a large sum of money.
Some boys would have kept it."</p>

<p>"None of my boys would," said Mark Nelson
proudly.</p>

<p>"Of course not. They're too well brought
up."</p>

<p>"Tom told me that you offered to advance
money enough to get him to California," said
Mr. Nelson, coming to business.</p>

<p>"On satisfactory security," added the squire
cautiously.</p>

<p>"You proposed to increase the mortgage on
my place?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the squire. "I wouldn't have
done it, though, Neighbor Nelson, but for the
good turn the boy did me. I am not at all
particular about increasing the amount of
the mortgage, but, if by so doing it I can promote
Tom's views, I won't object."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Tom gratefully.</p>

<p>"It is a serious step for me to take," continued
Mr. Nelson, "for I feel the incumbrance
to be a heavy one already. In fact, it is with
difficulty that I pay the interest. But the
time has come when Tom should start in life,
and in this village there seems to be no opening."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"None whatever," said the squire, in a tone
of decision.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the prospects in
California?" asked Mark Nelson. "You are
a man of business, and can judge better than
I. Are the stories we hear of fortunes made
in a short time to be relied upon?"</p>

<p>"As to that," said the squire deliberately,
"I suppose we can't believe all we hear; we
must make some allowances. But, after all,
there's no doubt of the existence of gold in
large quantities; I am satisfied of that."</p>

<p>"Then about the wisdom of sending out a
boy like Tom, alone; do you think it best?"</p>

<p>"It depends altogether on the boy," responded
the squire. "If he is honest, industrious,
and energetic, he will make his
way. You know your own boy better than
I do."</p>

<p>"He is all you say, Squire Hudson. I have
a great deal of confidence in Tom."</p>

<p>Tom looked at his father gratefully. Sometimes
it does a boy good to learn that the older
people have confidence in him.</p>

<p>"Then let him go," said the squire. "I
stand ready to furnish the money. I think
you said you needed two hundred dollars."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>This question was put to Tom, and the boy
answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the squire. "As soon as
the necessary writings are made out, the money
shall be ready."</p>

<p>"It's all settled!" thought Tom triumphantly.</p>

<p>At that moment Sinclair Hudson, the
squire's only son, opened the door and looked
into the room.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tom Nelson," said he, rather rudely.
"What brings you here?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>TOM ARRIVES IN PITTSBURG.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I came</span> on business, Sinclair," answered
Tom, smiling.</p>

<p>"Thomas is going to California, Sinclair,"
explained Squire Hudson.</p>

<p>Sinclair opened wide his eyes in amazement.
"What for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To dig gold and make my fortune," answered
Tom complacently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come out and tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"You can go, Thomas," said Squire Hudson
graciously. "Your father and I will settle the
business."</p>

<p>"Is it true that you are going to California?"
asked Sinclair, when they were out
in the front yard.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How soon do you go?"</p>

<p>"I want to get away in a week."</p>

<p>"What has my father to do with it?" inquired
Sinclair.</p>

<p>"He is going to lend me the money to get
there."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Then he is a greater fool than I thought,"
said Sinclair, with characteristic politeness.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" demanded our
hero, justly nettled.</p>

<p>"Because he'll never see the money again."</p>

<p>"Yes, he will. My father is responsible for
it."</p>

<p>"Your father is a poor man."</p>

<p>"He is able to pay that, if I don't; but I
hope he won't have to."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you really expect to find gold?" asked
Sinclair curiously.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do. Others have, and why
shouldn't I? I am willing to work hard."</p>

<p>"Do you think you'll come home rich?"</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"I have a great mind to ask father to let
me go with you," said Sinclair unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like it. You haven't been
brought up to work," said Tom, rather
startled, and not much pleased with the proposal,
for Sinclair Hudson was about the last
boy he wished as a companion.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't go to work. I would go as
a gentleman, to see the country. Wait a minute;
I will run in and ask him."</p>

<p>So Sinclair ran into the house, and preferred
his request.</p>

<p>"That's a wild idea, Sinclair," said his
father quickly.</p>

<p>"Why is it? I'm as old as Tom Nelson."</p>

<p>"He is going because it is necessary for him
to earn his living."</p>

<p>"He will have a splendid time," grumbled
the spoiled son.</p>

<p>"You shall travel all you want to when you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
are older," said his father. "Now you must
get an education."</p>

<p>"I want to travel now."</p>

<p>"I will take you to New York the next time
I go."</p>

<p>"Give me five dollars besides."</p>

<p>The money was handed him.</p>

<p>He went out and reported to Tom that he
was going to travel all over the world when he
was a little older, and had decided not to go
to California now.</p>

<p>"If you have money enough you can go with
me," he added graciously.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom politely, though
the prospect of having Sinclair for a traveling
companion did not exhilarate him much.</p>

<p>For a few days Mrs. Nelson was very busy
getting Tom ready to go. It was well, perhaps,
that so much needed to be done, for it
kept her mind from the thought of the separation.</p>

<p>The question of which route to take, whether
by steamer or across the plains, demanded consideration.
It was finally decided that Tom
should go overland. It was thought he might
join some company at St. Joseph&mdash;or St. Joe,
as it was then, and is now, popularly called&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
pay his passage in services, thus saving
a good share of the two hundred dollars. That
was, of course, an important consideration.</p>

<p>"How shall I carry my money?" asked
Tom.</p>

<p>"It will be best to take gold, and carry it
for safety in a belt around your waist," said
his father. "You must be very prudent and
careful, or you may be robbed. That would
be a serious thing for you, as I could not forward
you any more money."</p>

<p>"I will be very prudent, father," said Tom.
"I know the value of money too well to risk
losing it."</p>

<p>Well, the days of preparation were over at
length, and Tom stood on the threshold, bidding
good-by to his parents and his brothers
and sisters. He had not realized till now what
it was to leave home on a long journey of indefinite
duration. He wanted to be heroic,
but in spite of himself his eyes moistened, and
he came near breaking down.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to part with you, my
dear child," said his mother.</p>

<p>"Think that it is all for the best, mother,"
said Tom, choking. "Think of the time when
I will come back with plenty of money."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"God bless you, Tom!" said his father.
"Don't forget your good habits and principles
when you are far away from us."</p>

<p>"I won't, father."</p>

<p>So Tom's long journey commenced.</p>

<p>Tom's plan was to go to St. Louis first. His
father made some inquiries about the route,
and recommended going to Pittsburg by cars,
then to take the boat on the Ohio River for
Cincinnati. This seemed to Tom to afford a
pleasant variety, and he gladly accepted the
suggestion.</p>

<p>As they were approaching Pittsburg, Tom
occupied a whole seat on the left-hand side of
the car. A brisk, plausible young man, of
twenty-five, passing through the aisle, observed
the vacant seat, and, pausing, inquired, "Is
this seat engaged?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered Tom.</p>

<p>"Then, if you have no objection, I will
occupy it."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>The young man was nicely dressed. In his
bosom sparkled a diamond pin, and he wore
three or four rings on his fingers.</p>

<p>"He must be rich," thought Tom, who was
of an observant turn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"A pleasant day to travel," remarked the
young man affably.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Do you go farther than Pittsburg?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am going to California," answered
Tom proudly.</p>

<p>"Is it possible? Are you alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You are young to travel so far."</p>

<p>"I am sixteen; that is, I shall be in two or
three weeks."</p>

<p>"Still, you are young to take such a journey
alone. Are you going to join friends there?"</p>

<p>"No; I am going to seek my fortune."</p>

<p>Once more the young man looked surprised,
and scanned Tom curiously.</p>

<p>"I presume you are from the city," he observed,
with a smile which Tom would not
have understood if he had noticed it. The
truth is, that Tom bore evident marks of being
a country boy. I don't like to say that he
looked "green," but he certainly lacked the
air that distinguishes a town-bred boy. His
companion evidently understood boy nature,
for Tom was much flattered by the supposition
that he was a city boy.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, almost as if apologizing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
for a discreditable fact; "I am from the country."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed the other,
in apparent surprise. "I thought, from your
appearance, that you were from the city. How
do you go from Pittsburg?"</p>

<p>"By river to Cincinnati."</p>

<p>"Do you really? I am glad to hear it; I
am going there myself. We shall be fellow
passengers. That will be pleasant."</p>

<p>Tom thought it would. His companion
seemed very pleasant and social, and he had
been feeling lonely, as was only natural.</p>

<p>"Yes, it will," he said.</p>

<p>"By the way, as we may be thrown together,
more or less, we ought to know each other.
My name is Milton Graham. My father is a
rich merchant in New York. I am traveling
partly on business for my father's firm, and
partly for pleasure."</p>

<p>"My name is Thomas Nelson; most people
call me Tom," said our hero.</p>

<p>"Then I will call you Tom," said Graham.
"I like the name. I have a favorite cousin
named Tom. Poor boy!&mdash;he is an orphan.
His father died two years ago, leaving him
two hundred thousand dollars. My father is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
his guardian. He is about your age; only not
quite so good-looking."</p>

<p>Tom blushed. He had not thought much of
his own looks, but he was human, and no one
is displeased at being considered good-looking.
Mr. Graham spoke meditatively, as if he was
not intending to pay a compliment, only mentioning
a fact, and Tom did not feel called
upon to thank him for this flattering remark.</p>

<p>"That is a great deal of money," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. All my relations are rich; that
is, except one uncle, who probably is not worth
over twenty thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Tom was impressed. A man who could talk
of such a sum in such terms must certainly
be very rich.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mr. Graham," he inquired,
"how soon the steamer will start after we
reach Pittsburg?"</p>

<p>"No; but I can find out after we reach
there."</p>

<p>On arriving at Pittsburg, inquiry was made,
and it was ascertained that the steamer <i>River
Belle</i> would leave at nine o'clock the following
morning.</p>

<p>"We shall have to go to a hotel," said
Graham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there any cheap hotel here?" asked
Tom prudently.</p>

<p>"Yes; there is the Pittsburg House. Suppose
we both go there."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Mr. Graham had only a small carpetbag,
smaller than Tom's. They took them in their
hands, and walked for a short distance, till
they reached a plain building, which, from the
sign, Tom discovered to be the hotel which
had been mentioned.</p>

<p>"Shall we room together? It will cost less,"
said Milton Graham carelessly.</p>

<p>"If you please," said Tom.</p>

<p>He was lonely and thought he would like
company. Besides, it would be cheaper, and
that was a weighty consideration.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE PITTSBURG HOUSE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> and his companion entered the hotel.
At the left was the clerk's desk. Milton Graham
naturally took the lead. He took a pen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
from the clerk, and entered his name with a
flourish. Then he handed the pen to Tom, who
followed his example, omitting the flourish,
however.</p>

<p>"This young gentleman will room with me,"
said Graham.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said the clerk. "Will you
go up to your room now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The porter was summoned, and handed the
key of No. 16. He took the two carpetbags,
and led the way up-stairs, for the Pittsburg
House had no elevator. Even in the best
hotels at that time this modern convenience
was not to be found.</p>

<p>The door of No. 16 was opened, revealing
a plain room, about twelve feet square, provided,
as Tom was glad to see, with two narrow
beds.</p>

<p>"Have you got a quarter, Tom?" asked
Graham.</p>

<p>Tom drew one from his pocket.</p>

<p>Graham took it and handed it to the porter,
who expressed his thanks.</p>

<p>"It's always customary to fee the porter,"
he said carelessly, in answer to Tom's look of
surprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"For bringing up the baggage."</p>

<p>"Twenty-five cents for bringing up two
small carpetbags! That's pretty high. I'd
have brought them up myself, if I had known,"
said Tom, dissatisfied, for he felt that this
fee was hardly in accordance with his resolutions
of economy.</p>

<p>"Oh, he expects it. It's his regular perquisite.
When you've traveled more you'll
understand."</p>

<p>"How much are we to pay for our accommodations?"
asked Tom anxiously.</p>

<p>"About two dollars apiece, I reckon."</p>

<p>"That's more than I can afford," said Tom,
alarmed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is less, as we room together."</p>

<p>"I hope so, for I can't afford to be extravagant."</p>

<p>"Do you call two dollars a day extravagant?"
asked Graham, smiling.</p>

<p>"It is for me. My father is poor."</p>

<p>"Oh, it'll be all right. I'll fix it with the
clerk. If you are ready, suppose we go down
and have some supper."</p>

<p>To this Tom had no objection. He washed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
his hands and face, and brushed his hair; then
he declared himself ready.</p>

<p>Tom was hungry, and did justice to the supper,
which he found very good. As they
left the table, and reentered the office of the
hotel, Milton Graham said, "I am going to
make a call on some friends. Sorry to leave
you, but we shall meet later in the evening."</p>

<p>"All right," said Tom.</p>

<p>On the whole he did not regret being alone.
He began to doubt whether Graham would
make a desirable traveling companion. Tom
felt the need of economy, and he saw that his
companion would make it difficult. If a fee
must be paid, it was fair to divide it; but the
porter's fee had come out of Tom's pocket.</p>

<p>"Didn't he have a quarter, I wonder?"
thought our hero.</p>

<p>It was a small matter, but economy must
begin in small matters, or it is not likely to
be practised at all.</p>

<p>He took the opportunity to go to the desk
and ascertain the sum likely to be charged for
his accommodations.</p>

<p>"How long do you stay?" asked the clerk
pleasantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Till to-morrow morning. I am going to
sail in the <i>River Belle</i>."</p>

<p>"Then we shall charge you a dollar and a
half."</p>

<p>This seemed large to Tom, but he made no
objection.</p>

<p>"How much would it have been if I had
roomed alone?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The same. We make no change in our
terms on that account."</p>

<p>"Mr. Graham told me it would be cheaper
to room together."</p>

<p>"He is your roommate, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"He is mistaken, so far as our house is
concerned. I suppose you have known him for
some time."</p>

<p>"No, sir. I met him on the cars yesterday
afternoon for the first time."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know anything about
him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Tom. "He is the son
of a rich merchant in New York."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>The clerk was a man of middle age. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
home he had a son of Tom's age, and this led
him to feel a friendly interest in our hero.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have never traveled much,"
he said.</p>

<p>"No, sir. This is my first journey."</p>

<p>"Are you going far?"</p>

<p>"To California."</p>

<p>"That is a long journey for a boy of your
age," said the clerk, looking surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but I can't get anything to do
at home, and I am going to California to seek
my fortune."</p>

<p>"I hope you will be successful," said the
clerk, with hearty sympathy. "Will you let
me give you a piece of advice?"</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad of it, sir," responded
Tom. "I find I am quite inexperienced."</p>

<p>"Then don't trust strangers too readily.
It is dangerous."</p>

<p>"Do you refer to Mr. Graham?" asked Tom,
startled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I refer to him, or any other chance
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Don't you think he is all right?" asked
our hero anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't think he is the son of a rich merchant
in New York."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why should he tell me so?"</p>

<p>Tom was green, and I have no intention
of concealing it.</p>

<p>"I can't tell what his designs may be. Did
you tell him that you were going to California?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then he will, of course, conclude that you
have money. Did you tell him where you keep
it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I keep it in a belt around my
waist."</p>

<p>"You are too ready to tell that, though
with me the information is safe. You are to
room together. What will be easier, then,
for your companion to rob you during the
night?"</p>

<p>"I'd better take a room alone," said Tom,
now thoroughly alarmed.</p>

<p>"I should advise you to, in most cases, but
at present it may be as well to let things remain
as they are, as it will save an awkward
explanation."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to be robbed."</p>

<p>"We have a safe in the office&mdash;there it is&mdash;in
which we deposit articles of value intrusted
to us by our guests. Then we become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
responsible for them. I advise you to leave
your money with us overnight."</p>

<p>"I will," said Tom, relieved. "I shall have
to go to my room to remove it."</p>

<p>"Very well. If you have a watch, or any
other valuable, it will be well to put those in
our charge also."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I have nothing of consequence but
the money."</p>

<p>The belt of money was deposited in the safe,
and Tom felt relieved. He began to realize
for the first time the need of prudence and caution.
It had never occurred to him that a nice,
gentlemanly-looking man, like Milton Graham,
was likely to rob him of his scanty means.
Even now he thought there must be some mistake.
Still he felt that he had done the right
thing in depositing the money with the clerk.
The mere thought of losing it, and finding
himself high and dry&mdash;stranded, so to speak&mdash;hundreds
of miles from home, made him
shudder. On the whole, Tom had learned a
valuable, though an unpleasant, lesson. The
young are by nature trustful. They are disposed
to put confidence in those whom they
meet, even for the first time. Unhappily, in
a world where there is so much evil as there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
is in ours, such confidence is not justified.
There are too many who make it a business
to prey on their fellows, and select in preference
the young and inexperienced.</p>

<p>It was only seven o'clock. Tom had a
curiosity to see the city of Pittsburg, with
whose name he had been familiar. So, after
parting with his treasure, he went out for a
walk. He did not much care where he went,
since all was alike new to him. He ascertained,
on inquiry, that Smithfield Street was
the principal business thoroughfare. He inquired
his way thither, and walked slowly
through it, his attention fully occupied by
what he saw.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>GRAHAM IN HIS TRUE COLORS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> strayed into a street leading from the
main thoroughfare. Presently he came to a
brilliantly-lighted liquor saloon. As he paused
in front of the door, a heavy hand was laid
upon his shoulder, and, looking up, he met the
glance of a well-dressed gentleman, rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
portly, whose flushed face and uncertain gait
indicated his condition. He leaned rather
heavily upon Tom, apparently for support,
for he seemed to have been drinking more
than was good for him.</p>

<p>"My young friend," he said, "come in and
take a drink."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, but I would rather not,"
said Tom, startled.</p>

<p>"It won't hurt you. It don't hurt me."</p>

<p>As he uttered these last words he came near
falling. In his effort to save himself he
clutched Tom by the arm, and nearly pulled
him over. Our hero was anxious to get away.</p>

<p>"Are you sure it don't hurt you?" he could
not help saying.</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm drunk?" demanded the
other.</p>

<p>"I think you've taken more than is good
for you, sir," Tom answered bravely.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," muttered the gentleman,
trying to stand upright. "The drink's
gone to my legs. That's strange. Does it
ever go to your legs?"</p>

<p>"I never drink, sir."</p>

<p>"You're a most extraor'nary young man,"
hiccoughed Tom's new acquaintance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must bid you good-night, sir," said our
hero, anxious to get away.</p>

<p>"Don't go. I can't get home alone."</p>

<p>"Where do you live, sir?"</p>

<p>"I live in the country."</p>

<p>"Are you staying at a hotel?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Pittsburg House. Know Pittsburg
House?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I am staying there myself. Shall
I lead you there? You'd better not drink any
more."</p>

<p>"Jus' you say, my young frien'. You know
best."</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant, or, indeed, an easy
task to lead home the inebriate, for he leaned
heavily on Tom, and, being a large man, it
was as much as our hero could do to get him
along. As they were walking along Tom
caught sight of his roommate, Milton Graham,
just turning into a saloon, in company with
two other young men. They were laughing
loudly, and seemed in high spirits. Graham
did not recognize Tom.</p>

<p>"I hope he won't come home drunk,"
thought our hero. "It seems to me it is fashionable
to drink here."</p>

<p>Tom's experience of city life was very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
limited. It was not long before he learned
that Pittsburg was by no means exceptional
in this respect.</p>

<p>He ushered his companion safely into the
hotel, and then a servant took charge of him,
and led him to his room. Tom sat up a little
while longer, reading a paper he found in the
office, and then went to bed.</p>

<p>"I suppose Mr. Graham will come home
late," he said to himself. "I must leave the
door unlocked."</p>

<p>He soon went to sleep. How long he slept
he did not know, but suddenly awoke after
an interval. Opening his eyes he became conscious
that Graham had returned. He discovered
something more. His roommate, partially
undressed, and with his back turned to
Tom, was engaged in searching our hero's
pockets. This discovery set Tom broad awake
at once. He was not frightened, but rather
amused when he thought of Graham's disappointment.
He did not think it best to speak,
but counterfeited sleep.</p>

<p>"I wonder where the boy keeps his money,"
he heard Graham mutter. "Perhaps it is in
his coat pocket. No, there is nothing but a
handkerchief. He's more careful than I gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
him credit for. Perhaps it is under his pillow."</p>

<p>He laid down the clothes, and approached
the bed. Tom, with some effort, kept his eyes
firmly closed.</p>

<p>Graham slid his hand lightly under the
pillow, but withdrew it with all exclamation
of disappointment.</p>

<p>"He must have some money," he muttered.
"Ah, I have it! It is in his valise."</p>

<p>He approached Tom's valise, but it was
locked. He drew out a bunch of keys, and
tried one after the other, but in vain. Our
hero feared he might resort to violent means
of opening it, and turned in bed. Graham
wheeled round quickly.</p>

<p>Tom stretched, and opened his eyes languidly.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mr. Graham?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Graham nonchalantly,
proceeding to undress himself. "Have you
been abed long?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Tom. "What
time is it?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you got a watch?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not rich enough."</p>

<p>"It is one o'clock. I hadn't seen my friend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
for a long time, and couldn't get away till
late. By the way, have you got a key about
you? I can't open my carpetbag."</p>

<p>Tom thought of suggesting the bunch of
keys in Graham's pocket, but decided not to.</p>

<p>"My key is in my pants' pocket."</p>

<p>"Suppose you get it," said Graham. "I
don't like to feel in another person's pocket.
There might be some money there."</p>

<p>This was very scrupulous for one who had
already searched all Tom's pockets thoroughly.</p>

<p>Our hero got up, and got the key for his
roommate.</p>

<p>"No, it won't fit," said the young man, after
a brief trial. "It is too large."</p>

<p>Tom replaced the key in his pocket, confident
that Graham would in the course of the
night use it to open his valise. This, however,
did not trouble him.</p>

<p>"He won't think it worth while to steal my
shirts or stockings," he reflected, "and the
handkerchiefs are not worth taking."</p>

<p>"It will be rather awkward if I can't find
my keys," said Graham craftily. "I keep my
money in my valise."</p>

<p>He thought his unsophisticated companion
would reveal in turn where he kept his money;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
but Tom only said, "That is a good place,"
and, turning over, closed his eyes again.</p>

<p>During the night Tom's valise was opened,
as he ascertained in a simple way. In the
morning he found that the key was in the right
hand-pocket instead of the left, in which he
had placed it.</p>

<p>Upon Graham's last failure he began to
suspect what Tom had done with his money.</p>

<p>"The boy isn't so green as I thought," he
said to himself. "Curse his prudence! I
must get the money somehow, for I am
precious hard up."</p>

<p>He got up early, when Tom was yet asleep,
and went down to the office.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said to the clerk
affably.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir."</p>

<p>"My young friend and roommate left his
money with you last night. Please deliver it
to me."</p>

<p>"What is the number of your room?" asked
the clerk quietly.</p>

<p>"No. 16. Tom Nelson is my roommate."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he come for it himself?" inquired
the hotel clerk, with a searching glance
at Graham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"He wishes me to buy his steamboat ticket,"
answered Graham coolly. "He is going down
the river in my charge."</p>

<p>"Are you his guardian?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Graham, with cool effrontery.
"He is the son of an acquaintance of
mine, and I naturally feel an interest in the
boy."</p>

<p>"He told me he never met you till yesterday."</p>

<p>Graham was rather taken aback, but he
recovered himself quickly.</p>

<p>"That's pretty cool in Tom," he returned,
shrugging his shoulders. "I understand it,
though."</p>

<p>"I am glad you do," said the clerk sarcastically,
"for it <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dosen't'">doesn't</ins> look to me at all consistent
with what you represent."</p>

<p>"The fact is," said Graham plausibly,
"Tom has a feeling of independence, and
doesn't like to have it supposed that he is under
anybody's protection. That accounts for
what he told you. It isn't right, though, to
misrepresent. I must give him a scolding.
I am in a little of a hurry, so if you will kindly
give me the boy's money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It won't do, Mr. Graham," said the clerk,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
very firmly. "The money was put in our
charge by the boy, and it will be delivered only
to him."</p>

<p>"You seem to be very suspicious," said Graham
loftily. "Hand me my bill, if you please.
I will breakfast elsewhere."</p>

<p>The bill was made out, and paid. Five
minutes later Milton Graham, with an air of
outraged virtue, stalked out of the hotel, quite
forgetting the young friend who was under
his charge.</p>

<p>When Tom came down-stairs he was told of
the attempt to get possession of his money.</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to you for not letting
him have it," he said. "He searched my
clothes and valise during the night, but I said
nothing, for I knew he would find nothing
worth taking."</p>

<p>"He is a dangerous companion. If you
ever meet him again, I advise you to give him
a wide berth."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall follow your advice. If
you had not warned me against him he would
have stolen my money during the night."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE "RIVER BELLE."</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Tom took his place at the breakfast table,
he mechanically lifted his eyes and glanced
at his neighbors. Directly opposite him sat
the gentleman whom he had brought home the
evening before. Now he looked sober and
respectable. Indeed, he looked as if he might
be a person of some prominence. He met
Tom's glance, and recognized him.</p>

<p>"I think you are the boy who came home
with me last evening," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Tom, rather embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I was not quite myself," continued
the stout gentleman.</p>

<p>"Not quite, sir."</p>

<p>"I ought to be ashamed of myself, and I am.
I don't often allow myself to be caught in that
way. You did me a good service."</p>

<p>"You are quite welcome, sir."</p>

<p>"I had a good deal of money with me, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
if I had drank any more, I should probably
have been robbed."</p>

<p>"Why did you run such a risk, sir?" Tom
could not help asking.</p>

<p>"Because I was a fool," said the other
bluntly. "I have taste for drink, but when I
am at home I keep it under control."</p>

<p>"Then you don't live in Pittsburg, sir?"</p>

<p>"No. My home is in one of the river towns
in Ohio. I came to Pittsburg to collect money
due me for produce, and but for you should
probably have carried none of it home."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to be of service to you,"
said our hero sincerely.</p>

<p>"What are your plans, my young friend?
I suppose you are only a visitor in this city."</p>

<p>"I am on my way to California. I expect
to sail in the <i>River Belle</i> at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Then we shall be fellow passengers, and I
shall have a chance to become better acquainted
with you. You are young to go to
California alone. You are alone&mdash;are you
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>They went down to the boat together, and
on the way Tom told his story. He learned
that his acquaintance was Mr. Nicholas Waterbury;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that he had been a member of the Ohio
Legislature, and, as he inferred, was a prominent
citizen of the town in which he lived.</p>

<p>"I should be very much ashamed to have
them hear at home how I had forgotten myself,"
said Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>"It need not be known," said Tom. "I
shall not mention it to any one."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mr. Waterbury. "I
would rather you did not, as the news might
reach my home."</p>

<p>"Where do you live, sir?"</p>

<p>"In Marietta. I shall be glad to have you
leave the boat there, and stay a day or two
with me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, but I am in a hurry to
reach California, on my father's account. I
want to send back as soon as possible the
money he raised to pay my expenses out."</p>

<p>"That is very commendable; I can enter
into your feelings. I should like to show my
obligation to you in some way."</p>

<p>"It is not worth thinking about, sir," said
Tom modestly.</p>

<p>"Permit me to disagree with you. Why,
my young friend, how much money do you
think I had with me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"Upward of six hundred dollars."</p>

<p>As Mr. Waterbury uttered these words, a
young man, very dark, with narrow black
whiskers, passed them. He darted a quick
glance at the speaker, and walked rapidly on.
Tom noticed him, but not with attention.</p>

<p>"That is a good deal of money, sir," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"It would have been a good deal to lose,"
said Mr. Waterbury, "and I have no doubt I
should have lost it if it had not been for you."</p>

<p>"I haven't so much money as you, but I
came near losing it last night."</p>

<p>"How was that?" asked Tom's new acquaintance,
with curiosity.</p>

<p>Tom explained the attempt of his roommate
to rob him.</p>

<p>"It would have been a serious loss to you,
my young friend."</p>

<p>"It would have broken up all my plans, and
I should have had to work my way home,
greatly disappointed."</p>

<p>"You will need to be careful about forming
acquaintances. There are exceptions, however.
I am a new acquaintance; but I don't
think you need fear me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir," said Tom, smiling.</p>

<p>"While I have received a great service from
you, who are a new acquaintance. But here
we are at the steamer."</p>

<p>The <i>River Belle</i> lay at her pier. Tom and
his companion went on board. Both secured
tickets, and Tom provided himself with a stateroom,
for he expected to remain on board till
they reached Cincinnati. Freight of various
kinds was being busily stowed away below. It
was a busy and animated scene, and Tom
looked on with interest.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been on a steamboat before?"
asked Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>"No, sir. I have never traveled any to
speak of before leaving home on this journey,"
replied Tom.</p>

<p>"It will be a pleasant variety for you, then,
though the scenery is tame. However, some
of the river towns are pretty."</p>

<p>"I am sure I shall like it, sir."</p>

<p>"I wish I were going all the way with you&mdash;I
mean as far as Cincinnati," said Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>"I wish you were, sir."</p>

<p>"I have a great mind to do it," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
gentleman musingly. "I should have to go
very soon on business, at any rate, and I can
attend to it now just as well as later."</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad if you can make it
convenient, sir. We might occupy the same
stateroom."</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid that I shall follow the
example of your Pittsburg roommate?" asked
Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>"I have less to lose than you," answered
Tom. "Besides, I shall have to have a roommate,
as there are two berths."</p>

<p>"Precisely, and I might be safer than some.
I have a great mind to keep on. I shall see
some one on the pier in Marietta by whom I
can send word to my family. By the way, I
have a son about your age, and a daughter
two years younger."</p>

<p>"Have you, sir?" asked Tom, with interest.</p>

<p>"I should like you to meet them. Perhaps
you may some day."</p>

<p>"I hope I may," said Tom politely.</p>

<p>"I am a manufacturer," continued Mr.
Waterbury, "and sell my goods chiefly in
Pittsburg and Cincinnati. From these places
they are forwarded farther east and west."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose that's a pretty good business,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes; but there are intervals of depression.
However, I have no right to complain.
I began a poor boy, and now I am
moderately rich."</p>

<p>"Were you as poor as I am?" inquired Tom,
beginning to feel a personal interest in his
companion's career.</p>

<p>"Quite so, I fancy. At the age of sixteen
I couldn't call myself the owner of five dollars."</p>

<p>"And you have become rich?" said Tom,
feeling very much encouraged.</p>

<p>"Moderately so. I am probably worth fifty
thousand dollars, and am just fifty years of
age."</p>

<p>"That seems to me very rich," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I should have said the same thing at your
age. Our views change as we get older. Still,
I regard myself as very well off, and, with
prudent management, I need not fear reverses."</p>

<p>"I should think not," said Tom.</p>

<p>"You don't know how easy it is to lose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
money, my boy. I am not referring to robbery,
but to mismanagement."</p>

<p>"Your success encourages me, Mr. Waterbury,"
said Tom. "I am willing to work
hard."</p>

<p>"I think you will succeed. You look like
a boy of good habits. Energy, industry, and
good habits can accomplish wonders. But I
think we are on the point of starting."</p>

<p>Just before the gangplank was drawn in,
two persons hastily crossed it.</p>

<p>One was the dark young man who had
passed them on the way down to the boat;
the other was Milton Graham.</p>

<p>"Mr. Waterbury," said Tom hurriedly, "do
you see that man?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He is the man that tried to rob me."</p>

<p>"We must be on our guard, then. He may
be up to more mischief."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>ON THE STEAMER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> half an hour the <i>River Belle</i> was on her
way. Tom watched the city as it receded from
view. He enjoyed this new mode of travel
better than riding on the cars. He had never
before been on any boat except a ferry-boat,
and congratulated himself on his decision to
journey by boat part of the way.</p>

<p>Milton Graham had passed him two or
three times, but Tom, though seeing him, had
not volunteered recognition. Finding that
he must make the first advances, Graham
finally stopped short, looked full at our hero,
and his face wore a very natural expression
of surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, is that you?" he said, offering
his hand, which Tom did not appear to see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said our hero coldly.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect to see you here."</p>

<p>"I told you I intended to sail on the <i>River
Belle</i>."</p>

<p>"So you did; but I thought you had changed
your mind."</p>

<p>It made very little difference to Tom what
Mr. Graham thought, and he turned from him
to watch the scenery past which the boat was
gliding.</p>

<p>"I suppose," continued the young man,
"you were surprised to find me gone when you
came down-stairs to breakfast."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was."</p>

<p>"He resents it because I left him," thought
Graham. "I guess I can bring him around."</p>

<p>"The fact was," explained Graham, in a
plausible manner, "I went out to call on a
friend, meaning to come back to breakfast;
but he made me breakfast with him, and when
I did return you were gone. I owe you an
apology, Tom. I hope you will excuse my
unintentional neglect."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," said Tom indifferently;
"it's of no consequence."</p>

<p>Mr. Graham looked at him sharply. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
could not tell whether our hero was aware of
his dishonest intentions or not, but as Tom
must still have money, which he wanted to
secure, he thought it best to ignore his coldness.</p>

<p>"No," said he; "it's of no consequence as
long as we have come together again. By the
way, have you secured a stateroom?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"If the other berth is not taken, I should
like very much to go in with you," said Graham
insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"I have a roommate," said Tom coolly.</p>

<p>"You have? Who is it?" demanded Graham,
disappointed.</p>

<p>"That gentleman," answered Tom, pointing
out Mr. Nicholas Waterbury.</p>

<p>"Humph! do you know him?"</p>

<p>"I met him at the Pittsburg House."</p>

<p>"My young friend," said Graham, with the
air of a friendly mentor, "I want to give you
a piece of advice."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"Don't be too ready to trust strangers. This
Mr. Waterbury may be a very good man, but,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
on the other hand, he may be a confidence man.
Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Now, I suppose you have money?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Take care that he doesn't get possession
of it. There are men who go about expressly
to fleece inexperienced strangers."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know all about that," Tom
could not help saying.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Graham
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You are an old traveler, and must know
all about the sharpers."</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure," said Graham, immediately
dismissing his suspicions. "You couldn't
leave your companion, could you, and come
into my stateroom?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I could."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. It's of no consequence.
Keep a good lookout for your roommate."</p>

<p>Graham turned away, and resumed his walk.
Soon Tom saw him in company with the dark
young man, to whom reference has already
been made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said the latter, "how did you make
out with the boy?"</p>

<p>"He's offish. I don't know as he suspects
me. I wanted to get him into my stateroom,
but he has already taken up with another man&mdash;that
stout party over there."</p>

<p>"So I suspected. I can tell you something
about that man."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"He carries six hundred dollars about him."</p>

<p>"You don't say so! How did you find out?"</p>

<p>"I overheard him telling the boy so."</p>

<p>"That's important news. The boy must
have a couple of hundred, or thereabouts, as
he is on his way to California."</p>

<p>"Eight hundred dollars together! That
would make a good haul."</p>

<p>"So it would, but it won't be easy to get
it."</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on Tom
informed Mr. Waterbury of what had passed
between Graham and himself.</p>

<p>"So he warned you against me, did he?"
said Mr. Waterbury laughingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he thought I would be safer in his
company."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you want to exchange, I will retire,"
said Mr. Waterbury, smiling.</p>

<p>"Thank you; I would rather not. I am
glad I met you, or he might have managed to
get in with me."</p>

<p>It was not long before they came to a landing.
It was a small river village, whose neat
white houses, with here and there one of
greater pretensions, presented an attractive
appearance. A lady and her daughter came
on board here. The lady was dressed in black,
and appeared to be a widow. The girl was
perhaps fourteen years of age, with a bright,
attractive face. Two trunks were put on the
boat with them, and as they were the only
passengers from this landing, Tom inferred
that they were their property.</p>

<p>"That's quite a pretty girl," said Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Tom.</p>

<p>"You ought to get acquainted with her,"
said Mr. Waterbury jocosely.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Tom shyly, "you will get
acquainted with them, and then you can introduce
me."</p>

<p>"You are quite sharp," said Mr. Waterbury,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
laughing. "However, your hint is a good one.
I may act upon it."</p>

<p>It happened, however, that Tom required
no introduction. As the lady and her daughter
walked across the deck, to occupy some desirable
seats on the other side, the former
dropped a kid glove, which Tom, espying,
hastened forward and, picking up, politely
tendered to the owner.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said the lady, in a
pleasant voice. "I am much obliged."</p>

<p>"Mama is quite in the habit of dropping
her gloves," said the young girl, with a smiling
glance at Tom. "I really think she does
it on purpose."</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps, I had better keep near-by
to pick them up," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Really, Jennie," said her mother, "you are
giving the young gentleman a strange impression
of me."</p>

<p>"Well, mama, you know you dropped your
gloves in the street the last time you were in
Pittsburg, but there was no gentleman to pick
them up, so I had to. Are you going to Cincinnati?"
she asked, turning to Tom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and farther; I am going to California,"
replied Tom.</p>

<p>"Dear me, you will be quite a traveler. I
wish I were going to California."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like to go there on the same
business that I am."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"I am going to dig gold."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I suppose it isn't girl's
work; but if I saw any gold about, I should
like to dig for it. Is that your father that was
standing by you?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Tom. "I never met him
till yesterday. We were staying at the same
hotel in Pittsburg."</p>

<p>"He seems like quite a nice old gentleman."</p>

<p>Mr. Waterbury was not over fifty, but to the
young girl he seemed an old gentleman.</p>

<p>"I find him very pleasant."</p>

<p>There was a seat next to Jennie, and Tom
ventured to occupy it.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked the young
lady sociably.</p>

<p>"Thomas Nelson, but most people call me
Tom."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"My name is Jane Watson, but everybody
calls me Jennie."</p>

<p>"That is much prettier than Jane."</p>

<p>"So I think. Jane seems old-maidish, don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of becoming an old maid?"
asked Tom, smiling.</p>

<p>"Awfully. I wouldn't be an old maid for
anything. My school-teacher is an old maid.
She's horribly prim. She won't let us laugh,
or talk, or anything."</p>

<p>"I don't think you'll grow up like that."</p>

<p>"I hope not."</p>

<p>"How you run on, Jennie!" said her mother.
"What will this young gentleman think of
you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very bad, I hope," said Jennie,
smiling archly on Tom. "I suppose," she continued,
addressing him, "I ought to be very
quiet and reserved, as you are a stranger."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't be," said Tom heartily.</p>

<p>"Then I won't. Somehow you don't seem
like a stranger. You look a good deal like
a cousin of mine. I suppose that is the
reason."</p>

<p>So they chatted on for an hour or more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Jennie was very vivacious, occasionally droll,
and Tom enjoyed her company. The mother
saw that our hero was well-behaved and gentlemanly,
and made no objection to the sudden
intimacy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST DAY ON THE RIVER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">About</span> half-past twelve dinner was announced.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll sit next to us, Tom," said
Jennie Watson.</p>

<p>"I will, if I can."</p>

<p>It happened that Milton Graham entered
the saloon at the same time with the new
friends. He took the seat next to Jennie,
much to that young lady's annoyance.</p>

<p>"Will you be kind enough to take the next
seat?" she asked. "That young gentleman is
to sit next to me."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to resign the pleasure, but anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to oblige," said Graham. "Tom, I congratulate
you," he continued, with a disagreeable smile.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said our hero briefly.</p>

<p>"He calls you Tom. Does he know you?"
inquired Jennie, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I made his acquaintance yesterday for the
first time."</p>

<p>"I don't like his looks; do you?"</p>

<p>"Wait till after dinner and I will tell you,"
said Tom, fearing that Graham would hear.</p>

<p>Milton Graham saw that Jennie was pretty,
and desired to make her acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Tom," said he&mdash;for he sat on the other
side of our hero&mdash;"won't you introduce me
to your young lady friend?"</p>

<p>Tom was not well versed in etiquette, but
his good sense told him that he ought to ask
Jennie's permission first.</p>

<p>"If Miss Watson is willing," he said, and
asked her the question.</p>

<p>Jennie was not aware of Graham's real
character, and gave permission. She was perhaps
a little too ready to make new acquaintances.</p>

<p>"Do you enjoy this mode of travel, Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Watson?" said Graham, after the introduction.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I think it very pleasant."</p>

<p>"I suppose you wouldn't like the ocean as
well. I went to Havana last winter&mdash;on business
for my father&mdash;and had a very rough passage.
The steamer pitched and tossed, making
us all miserably seasick."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like that."</p>

<p>"I don't think you would; but we business
men must not regard such things."</p>

<p>Tom listened to him with incredulity. Only
the day before he would have put full confidence
in his statement; but he had learned a
lesson, thanks to Graham himself.</p>

<p>"How far are you going, Miss Watson?"
continued Graham.</p>

<p>"To Cincinnati. My mother and I are going
to live there."</p>

<p>"It is a very pleasant city. I have often
been there&mdash;on business."</p>

<p>"What is your business, Mr. Graham?"
Tom could not help asking.</p>

<p>"I see you are a Yankee," said Graham,
smiling. "Yankees are very inquisitive&mdash;always
asking questions."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you a Yankee, Mr. Graham?" asked
Jennie. "You asked me where I was going."</p>

<p>"A fair hit," said Graham. "No, I am not
a Yankee. I am a native of New York."</p>

<p>"And I of New Jersey," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are a foreigner then," said Graham.
"We always call Jerseymen foreigners."</p>

<p>"It is a stupid joke, I think," said Tom, who
was loyal to his native State.</p>

<p>"You didn't answer Tom's question," said
Jennie, who was a very straightforward young
lady.</p>

<p>"Oh, my father is a commission merchant,"
answered Graham.</p>

<p>"What does he deal in?"</p>

<p>"Articles too numerous to mention. Tom,
will you pass me the potatoes?"</p>

<p>Dinner was soon over, and the passengers
went upon deck. Graham lit a cigar.</p>

<p>"Have a cigar, Tom?" he said.</p>

<p>"No, thank you; I don't smoke."</p>

<p>"You'll soon learn. I'll see you again
soon."</p>

<p>"Tom," said Jennie, "tell me about this Mr.
Graham. What do you know about him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't like to tell what I know," said
Tom, hesitating.</p>

<p>"But I want you to. You introduced me,
you know."</p>

<p>"What I know is not to his advantage. I
don't like to talk against a man."</p>

<p>"You needn't mind telling me."</p>

<p>On reflection Tom decided that he ought to
tell what he knew, for he felt that Jennie
ought to be put on her guard against a man
whom he did not consider a suitable acquaintance
for her.</p>

<p>"Very well," said he, "if you promise not
to let him know that I have told you."</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>"He was my roommate last night at the
Pittsburg House," said Tom, in a low voice.
"During the night he tried to rob me."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" ejaculated Jennie, in
round-eyed wonder.</p>

<p>"I will tell you the particulars."</p>

<p>This Tom did. Jennie listened with indignation.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," she said. "Why
should the son of a merchant need to rob a boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
like you? He looks as if he had plenty of
money."</p>

<p>"So I thought; but the hotel clerk told me
that sharpers often appeared like this Mr.
Graham, if that is his name."</p>

<p>"How strange it seems!" said Jennie. "I
wish you hadn't introduced me."</p>

<p>"I didn't want to; but he asked, and at the
table I couldn't give my reasons for refusing."</p>

<p>"My dear child," said her mother, "you are
too ready to form new acquaintances. Let this
be a lesson for you."</p>

<p>"But some new acquaintances are nice,"
pleaded Jennie. "Isn't Tom a new acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"I will make an exception in his favor,"
said Mrs. Watson, smiling pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom. "How do you
know but I may be a pickpocket?" he continued,
addressing Jennie.</p>

<p>"As I have only ten cents in my pocket I
will trust you," said the young lady merrily.
"I'd trust you with any amount, Tom," she
added impulsively.</p>

<p>"Thank you, for your good opinion, Miss
Jennie."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't call me Miss Jennie. If you do, I'll
call you Mr. Tom."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't know myself by that title.
Then I'll call you Jennie."</p>

<p>"I wish you were going to live in Cincinnati,"
said the young lady. "It would be nice
to have you come and see us."</p>

<p>"I should like it; but I mustn't think so
much of pleasure as business."</p>

<p>"Like Mr. Graham."</p>

<p>"I must work hard at the mines. I suppose
I shall look pretty rough when I am there."</p>

<p>"When you've made your pile, Tom&mdash;that's
what they call it, isn't it?&mdash;you'll come back,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You must stop in Cincinnati on your way
home."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know where to find you."</p>

<p>"I will give you our address before we part.
But that will be some time yet."</p>

<p>About this time Graham, who had finished
smoking his cigar, strolled back.</p>

<p>"Miss Watson," said he, "don't you feel
like having a promenade?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Jennie suddenly. "Tom, come
walk with me."</p>

<p>Our hero readily accepted the invitation,
and the two walked up and down the deck.</p>

<p>"That's what I call a snub," said Graham's
friend, the dark-complexioned young man, who
was within hearing.</p>

<p>Graham's face was dark with anger.</p>

<p>"Curse her impudence, and his too!" he
muttered. "I should like to wring the boy's
neck."</p>

<p>"He can't help it, if the girl prefers his company,"
said the other, rather enjoying Graham's
mortification.</p>

<p>"I'll punish him all the same."</p>

<p>By this time Tom and Jennie were near him
again, on their return.</p>

<p>"You don't treat me with much ceremony,
Miss Watson," said Graham, with an evil
smile.</p>

<p>"My mother doesn't like me to make too
many acquaintances," said Jennie demurely.</p>

<p>"She is very prudent," sneered Graham.
"You have known your present companion
quite a long time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope to know him a long time," said the
young lady promptly. "Let's us continue our
walk, Tom."</p>

<p>In discomfiture which he was unable to hide,
Graham walked away.</p>

<p>"Evidently, Graham, you are no match for
those two youngsters," said his friend, in
amusement, which Graham did not share.</p>

<p>Graham did not reply, but seemed moody
and preoccupied.</p>

<p>Tom and his companion noticed Graham's
displeasure, but they felt indifferent to it.
They had no desire to continue his acquaintance.
Our hero introduced Mr. Waterbury to
his new friends, and this gentleman, who was
a thorough gentleman, except on the rare occasion
when he yielded to the temptation of
strong drink, made a favorable impression
upon both.</p>

<p>So the day passed. Tom enjoyed it thoroughly.
The river banks afforded a continuous
panorama, while the frequent stops gave
him an opportunity of observing the different
towns in detail. Two or three times he went
ashore, accompanied by Jennie, and remained
till the steamer was ready to start.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally night came, and one by one the
weary passengers retired to rest.</p>

<p>"Good night, Tom," said Jennie Watson.
"Be up early in the morning."</p>

<p>"So as to get an appetite for breakfast?"
asked Tom, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I think we shall both have appetites
enough; but it will be pleasant to breathe the
fresh morning air."</p>

<p>Tom promised to get up, if he wakened in
time.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, I will occupy the lower
berth," said Mr. Waterbury. "I can't climb
as well as you."</p>

<p>"All right, sir. It makes no difference to
me."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>NO. 61 AND NO. 62.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stateroom was small, as most staterooms
on river boats are. There appeared to
be no means of ventilation. Mr. Waterbury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
was a stout man, and inclined to be short-breathed.
After an hour he rose and opened
the door, so as to leave it slightly ajar. With
the relief thus afforded he was able to go to
sleep, and sleep soundly. Tom was already
asleep, and knew nothing of what had happened.</p>

<p>The number of the stateroom was 61. Directly
opposite was 62, occupied by Milton
Graham and his companion.</p>

<p>If Graham did not go to sleep it was because
his brain was busily scheming how to
obtain possession of the money belonging to
his neighbors.</p>

<p>"Won't your key fit?" asked Vincent, for
this was the name of the dark-complexioned
young man.</p>

<p>"No use, even if it does. Of course they will
lock it inside, and probably leave the key in
the lock."</p>

<p>About midnight, Graham, who had not fully
undressed, having merely taken off his coat,
got up, and, opening the door, peered out. To
his surprise and joy he saw that the door of
No. 61 was ajar. He at first thought of rousing
Vincent, who was asleep; but a selfish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
thought suggested itself. If he did this, he
must share with Vincent anything he might
succeed in stealing; if not, he could keep it all
himself.</p>

<p>He left his stateroom silently, and looked
cautiously around him. No one seemed to be
stirring in the cabin. Next he stepped across,
and, opening wider the door of 61, looked in.
The two inmates were, to all appearances,
sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>"So far, so good," he said to himself.</p>

<p>He stepped in, moderating even his breathing,
and took up a pair of pants which lay on
a chair. They belonged to Mr. Waterbury,
for Tom had merely taken off his coat, and
lain down as he was. His belt of gold he therefore
found it unnecessary to take off.</p>

<p>Graham saw at once, from the size of the
pants, that they must belong to the elder passenger.
This suited him, however, as he knew
from Vincent's information that Mr. Waterbury
had six hundred dollars, and Tom could
not be supposed to have anything like this
sum. He felt eagerly in the pockets, and
to his great joy his hand came in contact with
a pocketbook. He drew it out without ceremony.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
It was a comfortable-looking wallet,
fairly bulging with bills.</p>

<p>"He's got all his money inside," thought
Graham, delighted. "What a fool he must be
to leave it so exposed&mdash;with his door open,
too!"</p>

<p>At this moment Graham heard a stir in the
lower berth. There was no time to wait. He
glided out of the room, and reentered his own
stateroom. Immediately after his departure
Mr. Waterbury, who had awakened in time to
catch sight of his receding figure, rose in his
berth, and drew toward him the garment which
Graham had rifled. He felt in the pocket,
and discovered that the wallet had been
taken.</p>

<p>Instead of making a fuss, he smiled quietly,
and said: "Just as I expected."</p>

<p>"I wonder if they have robbed Tom, too," he
said to himself.</p>

<p>He rose, closed the door, and then shook
Tom with sufficient energy to awaken him.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" asked Tom, in some bewilderment,
as he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"It's I&mdash;Mr. Waterbury."</p>

<p>"Is it morning? Have we arrived?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, it is about midnight."</p>

<p>"Is there anything the matter?"</p>

<p>"I want you to see if you have been robbed.'"</p>

<p>Tom was broad awake in an instant.</p>

<p>"Robbed!" he exclaimed, in alarm. He
felt for his belt and was relieved.</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "What makes you
ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I have had a wallet taken. It
makes me laugh when I think of it."</p>

<p>"Makes you laugh!" repeated Tom, under
the transient impression that his companion
was insane. "Why should you laugh at the
loss of your money?"</p>

<p>"I saw the thief sneak out of the stateroom,"
continued Mr. Waterbury; "but I
didn't interfere with him."</p>

<p>"You didn't!" said Tom, completely mystified.
"I would. Did you see who it was?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it was your friend and late roommate."</p>

<p>"Mr. Graham?"</p>

<p>"As he calls himself. I don't suppose he
has any rightful claim to the name."</p>

<p>"Surely, Mr. Waterbury, you are not going
to let him keep the money," said Tom energetically;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
"I'll go with you, and make him
give it up. Where is his stateroom?"</p>

<p>"Just opposite&mdash;No. 62."</p>

<p>"We had better go at once," said Tom, sitting
up in his berth.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; he's welcome to all there is in the
pocketbook."</p>

<p>"Wasn't there anything in it?"</p>

<p>"It was stuffed full."</p>

<p>Tom was more than ever convinced that his
roommate was crazy. He had heard that misfortune
sometimes affected a man's mind; and
he was inclined to think that here was a case
in point.</p>

<p>"You'll get it back," said he soothingly.
"Graham can't get off the boat. We will report
the matter to the captain."</p>

<p>"I don't care whether I get it back or not,"
said Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>Tom looked so confused and bewildered that
his companion felt called upon to end the
mystification.</p>

<p>"I know what is in your mind," he said,
smiling. "You think I am crazy."</p>

<p>"I don't understand how you can take your
loss so coolly, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I will explain. That wallet was a
dummy."</p>

<p>"A what, sir?"</p>

<p>"A sham&mdash;a pretense. My pocketbook and
money are safe under my pillow. The wallet
taken by your friend was filled with imitation
greenbacks; in reality, business circulars of a
firm in Marietta."</p>

<p>Tom saw it all now.</p>

<p>"It's a capital joke," he said, laughing.
"I'd like to see how Graham looks when he
discovers the value of his prize."</p>

<p>"He will look green, and feel greener, I suspect,"
chuckled Mr. Waterbury. "You are
certain you have lost nothing, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly certain, sir."</p>

<p>"Then we won't trouble ourselves about
what has happened. I fancy, however, it will
be best to keep our own door locked for the remainder
of the night, even at the risk of suffocation."</p>

<p>"That's a capital trick of yours, Mr. Waterbury,"
said Tom admiringly.</p>

<p>"It has more than once saved me from robbery.
I have occasion to travel considerably,
and so am more or less exposed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder if Graham will discover the cheat
before morning."</p>

<p>"I doubt it. The staterooms are dark, and
the imitation is so good that on casual inspection
the strips of paper will appear to be genuine
greenbacks."</p>

<p>Mr. Waterbury retired to his berth, and was
soon asleep again. Tom, as he lay awake,
from time to time laughed to himself, as he
thought of Graham's coming disappointment,
and congratulated himself that he and that
young man were no longer roommates.</p>

<p>When Graham returned to his stateroom
Vincent, who was a light sleeper, was aroused
by the slight noise he made.</p>

<p>"Are you up, Graham?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; I got up a minute."</p>

<p>"Have you been out of the stateroom?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To get a glass of water."</p>

<p>There was a vessel of water in the cabin, and
this seemed plausible enough.</p>

<p>"Any chance of doing anything to-night?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not."</p>

<p>Vincent sank back on his pillow, and Graham<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
got back into his berth. Quietly he drew
the wallet from his pocket, in which he had
placed it, and eagerly opened it. The huge
roll of bills was a pleasant and welcome
sight.</p>

<p>"There's all of six hundred dollars here!"
he said to himself. "I mustn't let Vincent
know that I have them."</p>

<p>It occurred to Graham that, of course, Mr.
Waterbury would proclaim his loss in the
morning, and it also occurred to him that he
might be able to fasten suspicion upon Tom,
who, as his roommate, would naturally have
the best chance to commit the robbery. One
thing might criminate him&mdash;the discovery of
the wallet upon his person. He therefore
waited till Vincent was once more asleep, and,
getting up softly, made his way to the deck.
He drew the bills from the wallet, put them
in an inside pocket, and threw the wallet into
the river.</p>

<p>"Now I'm safe," he muttered, with a sigh of
relief. "The money may be found on me, but
no one can prove it is not my own."</p>

<p>He gained his berth without again awakening
his companion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"A pretty good night's work!" he said to
himself, in quiet exultation. "Alone I have
succeeded, while Vincent lies in stupid sleep.
He is no match for me, much as he thinks of
himself. I have stolen a march upon him this
time."</p>

<p>It is not in accordance with our ideas of
the fitness of things that a man who has committed
a midnight robbery should be able to
sleep tranquilly for the balance of the night,
but it is at any rate certain that Graham slept
soundly till his roommate awakened him in
the morning.</p>

<p>"Rouse up, Graham," he said. "Breakfast
is nearly ready."</p>

<p>"Is it?" asked Graham.</p>

<p>"Instead of sleeping there, you ought to be
thinking how we can make a forced loan from
our acquaintances in 61."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Graham, smiling. "I am
rather stupid about such things. Have you
any plan to suggest?"</p>

<p>"You seem very indifferent all at once,"
said Vincent.</p>

<p>"Not at all. If you think of anything
practical I am your man."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>He longed to get rid of Vincent, in order to
have an opportunity of counting his roll of
bills.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>GRAHAM'S DISAPPOINTMENT.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Milton Graham</span>, on reaching a place where
he could do so unobserved, drew from his
pocket the roll of bills, with a smile of exultation.
But the smile faded, and was succeeded
by a look of dismay, when he recognized the
worthlessness of his booty. An oath rose to his
lips, and he thrust the roll back into his pocket,
as he noticed the approach of a passenger.</p>

<p>"It's a cursed imposition!" he muttered to
himself, and he really felt that he had been
wronged by Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>"What are you doing out here, Graham?"
asked Vincent, for it was his confederate who
approached.</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular. Why?" responded
Graham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"What makes you look so glum?"</p>

<p>"Do I look glum?"</p>

<p>"You look as if you had but one friend in
the world, and were about to lose him."</p>

<p>"That may be true enough," muttered Graham.</p>

<p>"Come, man, don't look so downcast."</p>

<p><a name="repeat" id="repeat"></a>"I'm out of luck, and out of cash, Vincent."</p>

<p>"We're both in the same boat, as far as that
goes; but that isn't going to last. How about
our stout friend? Can't we make him contribute
to our necessities?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe he's got any money."</p>

<p>"No? Why, I heard him tell the boy he
had six hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Where does he keep it?"</p>

<p>"In his pocketbook probably."</p>

<p>"Will you oblige me by stating how we are
going to get hold of it?"</p>

<p>"I look to you for that."</p>

<p>"He's too careful. I leave you to try your
hand."</p>

<p>"Let me go in to breakfast. There's nothing
like a full stomach to suggest ideas."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>So the two went to the breakfast table, and
Graham, in spite of his disappointment, managed
to eat a hearty meal.</p>

<p>An hour later Mr. Waterbury and Tom were
standing on deck, conversing with Jennie
Watson and her mother, when Graham and
Vincent approached arm in arm. As soon as
they were within hearing distance Mr. Waterbury
purposely remarked, "By the way, Mrs.
Watson, I met with a loss last night."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" returned the lady.</p>

<p>Graham was about to push on, not wishing
Vincent to hear the disclosure, as it might
awaken his suspicions; but the latter's curiosity
was aroused.</p>

<p>"Wait, Graham," he said; and Graham,
against his will, was compelled to slacken his
pace.</p>

<p>"A man entered my stateroom during the
night, and stole a wallet from my coat pocket."</p>

<p>Graham changed color a little, and Vincent
seemed amazed.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that, Graham?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope you did not lose much," said Mrs.
Watson, in a tone of sympathy.</p>

<p>"I lost the wallet," said Mr. Waterbury,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Was there nothing in it?"</p>

<p>"It was full of bills."</p>

<p>Vincent looked at Graham with new-born
suspicion, but Graham looked indifferent.</p>

<p>"It appears to me that you take the loss
cheerfully," said Mrs. Watson, puzzled.</p>

<p>"I have reason to. The fact is, I was prepared
for the visit, and had filled the wallet
with bogus bills. I fancy they won't do my
visitor much good."</p>

<p>The lady smiled.</p>

<p>"You were fortunate, Mr. Waterbury," said
she. "Do you suspect any one of the theft?"</p>

<p>"I know pretty well who robbed me," returned
Mr. Waterbury, and he suffered his
glance to rest on Graham, who seemed in a
hurry to get away.</p>

<p>"Come along, Vincent," he said sharply.</p>

<p>Vincent obeyed. Light dawned upon him,
and he determined to verify his suspicions.</p>

<p>"Graham," said he, in a low voice, "you did
this."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did what?"</p>

<p>"You got that wallet."</p>

<p>Graham concluded that he might as well
make a clean breast of it, since it had become
a matter of necessity.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "suppose I did?"</p>

<p>"You were not going to let me know of it,"
said Vincent suspiciously.</p>

<p>"That is true. I was ashamed of having
been imposed upon."</p>

<p>"When did you find out that the money was
bogus?"</p>

<p>"Immediately."</p>

<p>"If it had been good, would you have shared
with me honorably?"</p>

<p>"Of course. What do you take me for?"</p>

<p>Vincent was silent. He did not believe his
companion. He suspected that the latter had
intended to steal a march on him.</p>

<p>"You might have told me of it," he continued,
in a tone of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"There was no need to say anything, as
there was nothing to divide."</p>

<p>"Have you got the wallet with you now?"</p>

<p>"No; I threw it overboard."</p>

<p>"And the bills?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may have them all, if you like."</p>

<p>"Come into the stateroom, where we can be
unobserved, and show them to me."</p>

<p>Graham complied with his suggestion.</p>

<p>"It would have been a good haul if they had
been genuine," said Vincent, as he unfolded
the roll.</p>

<p>"Yes, but they are not; worse luck!"</p>

<p>"I didn't give the old fellow credit for being
so sharp."</p>

<p>"Nor I. There's more in him than I supposed
there was."</p>

<p>"Well, what is to be done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. The old man is on his guard,
and, besides, he suspects me. He was probably
awake when I entered the stateroom. He and
the boy have probably laughed over it together.
I hate that boy."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he is a green country boy, and yet
he has succeeded in thwarting me. I am
ashamed whenever I think of it."</p>

<p>"Would you like to play a trick on him in
turn?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then give me this roll of bills."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want to do with them?"</p>

<p>"Put them in his pocket."</p>

<p>"Can you do it unobserved?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The fact is, Graham, I served an
apprenticeship as a pickpocket, and flatter
myself I still have some dexterity in that line."</p>

<p>"Very well, it will be some satisfaction, and
if the old man didn't see me enter the stateroom,
he may be brought to believe that the
boy robbed him. If that could be, I should
feel partly compensated for my disappointment.
I should like to get that boy into
trouble."</p>

<p>"Consider it done, so far as I am concerned.
Now let us separate, so as to avoid suspicion."</p>

<p>Vincent began to pace the deck in a leisurely
manner, in each case passing near Tom, who
was still engaged in conversation with Jennie
Watson and her mother. For a time he was
unable to effect his purpose, as our hero was
sitting down. But after a while Tom rose, and
stood with his back to Vincent. He wore a
sack coat, with side pockets. This was favorable
to Vincent, who, as he passed, adroitly
slipped the bills into one of them, without attracting
the attention of our hero.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently Tom thrust his hand into his
pocket mechanically. They encountered the
bills. In surprise he drew them out, and
looked at them in amazement.</p>

<p>"What's that, Tom?" asked Jennie, with
great curiosity.</p>

<p>"It looks like money," answered Tom, not
yet understanding what had happened.</p>

<p>"You seem to be rich."</p>

<p>"By gracious!&mdash;it's Mr. Waterbury's
money," exclaimed Tom. Then he colored, as
it flashed upon him that its presence in his
pocket might arouse suspicion. "I don't see
how it got there," he continued, in a bewildered
way.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Waterbury came up, and was
made acquainted with the discovery.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you'll think, Mr. Waterbury,"
said Tom, coloring; "I haven't the
slightest idea how the money came in my
pocket."</p>

<p>"I have," said Mr. Waterbury quietly.</p>

<p>Tom looked at him, to discover whether he
was under suspicion.</p>

<p>"The companion of your friend Graham
slipped it into your pocket. He was very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
quick and adroit, but I detected him. He
wanted to throw suspicion upon you."</p>

<p>"It is lucky you saw him, sir."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You might have suspected me."</p>

<p>"My dear boy, don't trouble yourself about
that. No circumstantial evidence will shake
my confidence in your integrity."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Tom gratefully.</p>

<p>"What a wicked man to play a trick on you,
Tom!" exclaimed Jennie indignantly.</p>

<p>"I see there is somebody else who has confidence
in you, Tom," said Mr. Waterbury,
smiling; "I'd like to give him a piece of my
mind."</p>

<p>"I am ready to forgive him," said Mr.
Waterbury, "as he has restored the money.
It will do as a bait for the next thief."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>COMING TO AN UNDERSTANDING.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I believe</span>, Tom," said Mr. Waterbury,
"that I will come to an understanding with
these officious acquaintances of yours. I will
intimate to them that their persecution must
cease."</p>

<p>"Will they mind what you say, sir?"</p>

<p>"I think they will," answered his friend
quietly.</p>

<p>Graham and Vincent were standing together,
and apart from the rest of the passengers,
when Mr. Waterbury approached them.</p>

<p>"A word with you, gentlemen," said he
gravely.</p>

<p>"I don't know you, sir," blustered Vincent.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. Permit me to remark that I
have no special desire for your acquaintance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why do you take the liberty of addressing
me?"</p>

<p>"I rather admire the fellow's impudence,"
said Mr. Waterbury to himself.</p>

<p>"Are you associated with this gentleman?"
he asked, indicating Graham.</p>

<p>"We are friends."</p>

<p>"Then I will address an inquiry to him. I
am not in the habit of receiving calls in my
stateroom during the hours of sleep."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, sir," said Milton
Graham, with hauteur.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do, unless your memory is
singularly defective. Our staterooms are close
together. You entered mine last night."</p>

<p>"You must have been dreaming."</p>

<p>"If so, I was dreaming with my eyes open.
Perhaps it was in my dreams that I saw you
extract a wallet from my coat pocket."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to insult me, sir?" demanded
Graham.</p>

<p>"Really, sir, your remarks are rather extraordinary,"
chimed in Vincent.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that I robbed you?"
demanded Graham, confident in the knowledge
that the booty was not on his person.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"I find a wallet missing. That speaks for
itself."</p>

<p>"Let me suggest that your roommate probably
took it," said Vincent.</p>

<p>"Extremely probable," said Graham. "He
roomed with me in Pittsburg, and I caught
him at my pockets during the night."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear the fable of the wolf and
the lamb, Mr. Graham?" asked Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>"Can't say I have."</p>

<p>"It's of no consequence. I am reminded of
it, however."</p>

<p>"Come to think of it," said Vincent, "I saw
the boy with a roll of bills. You had better
search him. If he is innocent, he can't object."</p>

<p>"I see your drift," returned Mr. Waterbury,
after a pause. "I saw you thrust the bills into
his pocket, as he stood with his back turned,
conversing with one of the passengers. It was
very skilfully done, but I saw it."</p>

<p>Vincent started, for he had supposed himself
unobserved.</p>

<p>"I see you are determined to insult us," he
said. "I will charitably conclude that you
are drunk."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't be so charitable with you, sir. I
believe you are a pair of precious scoundrels,
who, if you had your deserts, would be in the
penitentiary instead of at large."</p>

<p>"I have a mind to knock you down," said
Vincent angrily.</p>

<p>As Vincent was several inches shorter and
much slighter than the person whom he threatened,
this menace sounded rather ridiculous.</p>

<p>"You are at liberty to try it," said the latter,
smiling. "First, however, let me warn
you that, if you continue to annoy us, it will be
at your peril. If you remain quiet I shall
leave you alone. Otherwise I will make known
your true character to the captain and passengers,
and you will undoubtedly be set ashore
when we reach the next landing. I have the
honor to wish you good morning."</p>

<p>"It strikes me, Graham," said Vincent, as
Mr. Waterbury left them, "that we have
tackled the wrong passenger."</p>

<p>"I believe you are right," said Graham.
"Just my luck."</p>

<p>"There isn't much use in staying on the
boat. He will keep a good lookout for us."</p>

<p>"True; but I don't want to give up the boy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is under the guardianship of this determined
old party."</p>

<p>"They will separate at Cincinnati."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"He has money enough to take him to California.
He is worth following up."</p>

<p>"Then you are in favor of going on to Cincinnati?"</p>

<p>"By all means."</p>

<p>"Very well. There are always chances of
making an honest penny in a large city."</p>

<p>"Money or no money, I want to get even
with the boy."</p>

<p>So the worthy pair decided to go on to Cincinnati.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>THE ALLEGHANY HOUSE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a bright, sunny morning when the
<i>River Belle</i> touched her pier at Cincinnati.
The passengers gathered on deck, and discussed
their plans. In one group were Tom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Mr. Waterbury, Jennie Watson, and her
mother.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you are going to leave us, Tom,"
said Jennie; "I shall feel awfully lonely."</p>

<p>"So shall I," said Tom.</p>

<p>"What's the use of going to that hateful
California? Why can't you stay here with
us?"</p>

<p>"Business before pleasure, Jennie," said
her mother. "You mustn't forget that Tom
has his fortune to make."</p>

<p>"I wish he could make it in Cincinnati,
mother."</p>

<p>"So do I; but I must admit that California
presents a better prospect just at present. You
are both young, and I hope we may meet
Tom in after years."</p>

<p>"When I have made my pile," suggested
Tom.</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"You won't go right on, Tom, will you?"
asked Jennie. "You'll stay here a day or
two."</p>

<p>"Yes; I should like to see something of Cincinnati."</p>

<p>"And you'll call on us?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall be very happy to do so. Where are
you going to stay?"</p>

<p>"At the Burnet House. Won't you come
there, too?"</p>

<p>"Is it a high-priced hotel?"</p>

<p>"I believe it is."</p>

<p>"Then I can't afford to stay there; but I
can call on you all the same."</p>

<p>"Stay there as my guest, Tom," said Mr.
Waterbury cordially. "It shall not cost you
anything."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. You are very kind, but I
don't like to accept unnecessary favors. I
will put up at some cheap hotel, and call upon
you both."</p>

<p>"You would be heartily welcome, my boy,"
said Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>"I <ins title="This word not present in original text">don't</ins> doubt it, sir, and the time may
come when I will gladly accept your kindness,"
replied Tom.</p>

<p>"But now you mean to have your own way;
is that it, Tom."</p>

<p>"You won't be offended, sir?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I respect you for your
manly independence. You won't forget that
I am your friend?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't want to forget that, sir."</p>

<p>So it happened that while Mrs. Watson,
Jennie, and Mr. Waterbury registered at the
Burnet House, Tom, carpetbag in hand,
walked through the streets till he came to a
plain inn, bearing the name Alleghany House.
It is not now in existence, having given way
to an imposing business block.</p>

<p>"That looks as if it might suit my purse,"
thought Tom.</p>

<p>He walked in, and, approaching the desk,
inquired: "How much do you charge at this
hotel?"</p>

<p>"A dollar a day," answered the clerk.
"Will you have a room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Please register your name." Tom did so.</p>

<p>"Cato," called the clerk&mdash;summoning a
colored boy, about Tom's size&mdash;"take this
young man to No. 18."</p>

<p>"All right, sar," said Cato, showing his
ivories.</p>

<p>"When do you have dinner?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"One o'clock."</p>

<p>Preceded by Cato, Tom walked up-stairs,
and was ushered into a small, dingy room on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the second floor. There was a single window,
looking through dingy panes upon a back
yard. There was a general air of cheerlessness
and discomfort, but at any rate it was
larger than the stateroom on the <i>River Belle</i>.</p>

<p>"Is this the best room you have?" asked
Tom, not very favorably impressed.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sar," answered Cato. "If your
wife was with you, sar, we'd give you a
scrumptious room, 'bout twice as big."</p>

<p>"I didn't bring my wife along, Cato," said
Tom, amused. "Are you married?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, sar," answered his colored guide,
with a grin.</p>

<p>"I think we can wait till we are a little
older."</p>

<p>"Reckon so, sar."</p>

<p>"Just bring up a little water, Cato. I feel
in need of washing."</p>

<p>"Dirt don't show on me," said Cato, with
a guffaw.</p>

<p>"I suppose you do wash, now and then,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sar, sometimes," answered Cato
equivocally.</p>

<p>When Tom had completed his toilet he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
found that it was but ten o'clock. He accordingly
went down-stairs, intending to see
a little of the city before dinner.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>THE EVENTS OF A MORNING.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Graham</span> and Vincent had kept quiet during
the latter part of the voyage. They had
a wholesome fear of Mr. Waterbury, and kept
aloof from him and Tom. They even exchanged
their stateroom for one at a different
part of the boat. All was satisfactory to Tom
and his companion.</p>

<p>When the worthy pair reached Cincinnati
they were hard up. Their united funds
amounted to but seven dollars, and it seemed
quite necessary that they should find the
means of replenishing their purses somewhere.
They managed to ascertain that Tom and his
friend were going to separate, and this afforded
them satisfaction, since it made their designs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
upon our hero more feasible. At a distance
they followed Tom to the Alleghany House,
and themselves took lodgings at a small, cheap
tavern near-by. Like Tom, they set out soon
after their arrival in quest of adventure.</p>

<p>"We must strike a vein soon, Graham,"
said Vincent, "or we shall be in a tight
place."</p>

<p>"That's so," answered Graham.</p>

<p>"Thus far our trip hasn't paid very well.
It's been all outgo and no income."</p>

<p>"You're right, partner; but don't give up
the ship," responded Graham, whose spirits
returned, now that he was on dry land. "I've
been in the same straits about once a month
for the last five years."</p>

<p>"I've known you for three years, Graham,
and, so far as my knowledge extends, I can
attest the truth of what you say. By the way,
you never say anything of your life before
that date."</p>

<p>A shadow passed over Graham's face.</p>

<p>"Because I don't care to think of it; I never
talk of it," he said.</p>

<p>"Pshaw, man, we all of us have some
ugly secrets. Suppose we confide in each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
other. Tell me your story, and I will tell you
mine. It won't change my opinion of you."</p>

<p>"Probably not," said Graham. "Well,
there is no use in holding back. For this once
I will go back to the past. Five years ago I
was a favorite in society. One day an
acquaintance introduced me into a gambling
house, and I tried my hand successfully. I
went out with fifty dollars more than I
brought in. It was an unlucky success, for it
made me a frequent visitor. All my surplus
cash found a market there, and when that was
exhausted I borrowed from my employer."</p>

<p>"Without his knowledge?"</p>

<p>"Of course. For six months I evaded discovery.
Then I was detected. My friends interceded,
and saved me from the penitentiary,
but I lost my situation, and was required to
leave the city. I went to New York, tried to
obtain a situation there, failed, and then
adopted my present profession. I need not
tell you the rest."</p>

<p>"My dear friend, I think I know the rest
pretty well. But don't look sober. A fig for
the past. What's the odds, as long as you're
happy?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you happy?" inquired Graham.</p>

<p>"As long as I'm flush," answered Vincent,
shrugging his shoulders. "I'm nearly dead-broke
now, and of course I am miserable.
However, my story comes next in order. I
was a bank teller, appropriated part of the
funds of the bank, fled with it, spent it, and
then became an ornament to our common profession."</p>

<p>"Where was the bank?"</p>

<p>"In Canada. I haven't been there since.
The climate don't suit me. It's bleak, but I
fear it might prove too hot for me. Now we
know each other."</p>

<p>"You don't allow it to worry you, Vincent,"
said Graham.</p>

<p>"No, I don't. Why should I? I let the
dead past bury its dead, as Longfellow says,
and act in the living present. That reminds
me, we ought to be at work. I have a proposal
to make. We won't hunt in couples, but
separate, and each will try to bring home
something to help the common fund. Is it
agreed?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"<i>Au revoir</i>, then!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"That fellow has no conscience," thought
Graham. "Mine is callous, but he goes beyond
me. Perhaps he is the better off."</p>

<p>Graham shook off his transient dull spirits,
and walked on, keeping a sharp lookout for
a chance to fleece somebody. In front of a
railroad ticket office he espied a stolid-looking
German, who was trying to read the placard
in the window.</p>

<p>Graham approached him, and said politely,
"My friend, perhaps I can help you. Are you
thinking of buying a railroad ticket?"</p>

<p>The German turned, and his confidence was
inspired by the friendly interest of Graham's
manner.</p>

<p>"I go to Minnesota," he said, "where my
brother live."</p>

<p>"Exactly, and you want a ticket to go
there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I want a ticket. Do they sell him
here?"</p>

<p>"No," said Graham. "That is, they do
sell tickets here; but they ask too much."</p>

<p>"I will not pay too much," said the German,
shaking his head decisively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course not; I will take you to a cheaper
place."</p>

<p>"That is good," said the German, well
pleased. "It is luck I meet mit a friend like
you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Graham, linking his arm in that
of his new acquaintance. "I don't like to see
a worthy man cheated. Come with me. How
much money have you?"</p>

<p>This inquiry ought to have excited the suspicions
of the German; but he was trustful,
and answered promptly, "Two hundred dollar."</p>

<p>Graham's eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"If I could only get the whole of it," he
thought. But that didn't seem easy.</p>

<p>They walked through street after street till
Graham stopped in front of an office.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "give me your money, and
I will buy the ticket."</p>

<p>"How much money?" asked his new
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly," said Graham carelessly.
"Just hand me your pocketbook, and
I will pay what is needed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>But here the German's characteristic caution
came in.</p>

<p>"I will go with you," he said.</p>

<p>"If you do, I can't get the tickets so cheap.
The agent is a friend of mine, and if he thinks
it is for me he will give it to me for less. Don't
give me all your money. Fifty dollars will
do. I will buy the ticket, and bring you the
rest of the money."</p>

<p>This seemed plausible enough, and Graham
would have got what he asked for, but for the
interference of Tom, who had come up just
in time to hear Graham's proposal. He
had no difficulty in comprehending his purpose.</p>

<p>"Don't give him the money," he said. "He
will cheat you."</p>

<p>Both Graham and his intended victim
wheeled round, and looked at our hero.</p>

<p>"Clear out of here, you young vagabond!"
said Graham angrily.</p>

<p>"This man wants to cheat you," persisted
Tom. "Don't give him your money."</p>

<p>The bewildered foreigner looked from one to
the other.</p>

<p>"This is no ticket office," said Tom. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
will lead you to one, and you shall buy a
ticket for yourself."</p>

<p>"He wants to swindle you," said Graham
quickly.</p>

<p>"You shall keep your money in your own
hands," said Tom. "I don't want it."</p>

<p>"I go with you, my young friend," said the
German, convinced by Tom's honest face.
"The other man may be all right, but I go
with you."</p>

<p>Graham protested in vain. His victim went
off with Tom, who saw that he was provided
with the ticket he wanted. His new friend
tried to force a dollar upon him; but this Tom
steadily refused.</p>

<p>"I'll get even with you yet!" said Graham
furiously; but our hero was not disturbed by
this menace.</p>

<p>Vincent, meantime, was making a tour of
observation, ready for any adventure that
might put an honest or dishonest penny into
his pocket. About half an hour later he found
himself on the leading retail street in Cincinnati.
In front of him walked a lady, fashionably
attired, holding a mother-of-pearl portemonnaie
carelessly in her hand. He brushed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
by her, and at the same moment the pocketbook
was snatched from her hand.</p>

<p>The lady screamed, and instinctively
clutched Vincent by the arm.</p>

<p>"This man has robbed me, I think," she
said. The crowd began to gather about Vincent,
and he saw that he was cornered.
Among the crowd, unluckily for himself,
was Tom. By a skilful movement Vincent
thrust the portemonnaie into our hero's
pocket.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, madam," he said coolly;
"I saw that boy take your money."</p>

<p>Instantly two men seized Tom.</p>

<p>"Search him," said Vincent, "and see it
I am not right."</p>

<p>The portemonnaie was taken from Tom's
pocket, amid the hootings of the crowd.</p>

<p>"So young, and yet so wicked!" said the
lady regretfully.</p>

<p>"I didn't take the money, madam," protested
Tom, his face scarlet with surprise and
mortification.</p>

<p>"Don't believe him, ma'am. I saw him
take it," said Vincent virtuously.</p>

<p>Poor Tom looked from one to another; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
all faces were unfriendly. It was a critical
time for him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>TOM'S ARREST.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> one who is scrupulously honest a sudden
charge of dishonesty is almost overwhelming.
Now, Tom was honest, not so much because he
had been taught that honesty was a virtue,
as by temperament and instinct. Yet here
he saw himself surrounded by hostile faces,
for a crowd soon collected. Not one believed
in his innocence, not even the lady, who
thought it was such a pity that he was "so
young and yet so wicked."</p>

<p>"Will somebody call a policeman?" asked
Vincent.</p>

<p>A policeman soon made his appearance. He
was a stout, burly man, and pushed his way
through the crowd without ceremony.</p>

<p>"What's the row?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"This boy has picked a lady's pocket," exclaimed
Vincent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The officer placed his hand roughly on
Tom's shoulder.</p>

<p>"You were a little too smart, young feller!"
said he. "You must come along with
me."</p>

<p>"I didn't take the money," protested Tom,
pale, but in a firm voice.</p>

<p>"That's too thin," said Vincent, with a
sneer.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's too thin," repeated two or three
in the crowd.</p>

<p>"It's true," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll tell us how the money came
in your pocket," suggested a bystander.</p>

<p>"That man put it in," answered Tom, indicating
Vincent.</p>

<p>The latter shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"He says so, because I exposed him," he
remarked, turning to the crowd.</p>

<p>"Of course; that's a common game," interposed
the policeman.</p>

<p>"Have you any reason for what you say,
my boy?" asked a quiet-looking man, with a
pleasant face.</p>

<p>"Of course he hasn't," replied Vincent
hastily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"I spoke to the boy, sir."</p>

<p>"I have a reason," answered Tom. "A
friend of this man roomed with me at Pittsburg,
and during the night tried to rob me.
We were both passengers on the <i>River Belle</i>
on the last trip. During the trip he entered
our stateroom, and stole a wallet from my
roommate. This man slyly put it into my
pocket, in order to escape suspicion."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" exclaimed Vincent uneasily.
"Gentlemen, the boy is very artful,
and the greatest liar out."</p>

<p>"Of course he is!" assented the policeman.
"Come along, young feller!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said the quiet man.
"Have you any proof of your statements, my
boy, except your own word?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; my roommate will tell you the
same thing."</p>

<p>"Who is he? Where can he be found?"</p>

<p>"He is Mr. Nicholas Waterbury, of Marietta.
He is now at the Burnet House."</p>

<p>"That's all gammon!" said the officer
roughly. "Come along. I can't wait here all
day."</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry, officer," said the quiet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
man. "I know Mr. Waterbury, and I believe
the boy's story is correct."</p>

<p>"It ain't any of your business!" said the
officer insolently. "The boy's a thief, and
I'm goin' to lock him up."</p>

<p>"Look out, sir!" said the quiet man sternly.
"You are overstepping the limits of your duty,
and asserting what you have no possible means
of knowing. There is reason to believe that
this man"&mdash;pointing out Vincent&mdash;"is the
real thief. I call upon you to arrest him."</p>

<p>"I don't receive no orders from you, sir,"
said the policeman. "I'm more likely to take
you along."</p>

<p>"That's right, officer," said Vincent approvingly.
"The man is interfering with
you in the exercise of your duty. You have
a perfect right to arrest him."</p>

<p>"I have a great mind to," said the officer,
who was one of the many who are puffed up
by a little brief authority, and lose no opportunity
of exercising it.</p>

<p>The quiet man did not seem in the least
alarmed. He smiled, and said, "Perhaps, officer,
it might be well for you to inquire my
name, before proceeding to arrest me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded the officer insolently.</p>

<p>"I am Alderman Morris."</p>

<p>A great change came over the policeman.
He knew now that the quiet man before him
was President of the Board of Aldermen, and
he began to be alarmed, remembering with
what rudeness he had treated him.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said humbly;
"I didn't know you."</p>

<p>"What is your name, sir?" demanded the
alderman, in a tone of authority.</p>

<p>"Jones, sir."</p>

<p>"How long have you been on the force?"</p>

<p>"Six months, your honor."</p>

<p>"Then you ought to be better fitted for your
position by this time."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't take no offense at what
I said, not knowing you, alderman."</p>

<p>"That's no personal offense, but I object
to your pronouncing upon the guilt of parties
arrested when you know nothing of the
matter."</p>

<p>"Shall I take the boy along, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and this man also. I don't wish to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
interfere with the exercise of justice, but it is
my opinion that the boy is innocent."</p>

<p>"I protest against this outrage," said Vincent
nervously. "Am I to be punished because
I expose a thief?"</p>

<p>"Come along, sir," said the policeman.
"The alderman says so."</p>

<p>"I appeal to the gentlemen present," said
Vincent, hoping for a forcible deliverance.</p>

<p>"Madam," said the alderman to the lady
who had been robbed, "did you see the boy
take your pocketbook?"</p>

<p>"No, sir! I thought it was the man, till he
told me it was the boy, and the money was
found on the boy."</p>

<p>"I should think that told the story," said
Vincent. "Any man here might be arrested
as soon as I. Fellow citizens, is this a free
country, where a man of reputation can be
summarily arrested at the bidding of another?
If so, I would rather live under a
monarchy."</p>

<p>There was a murmur of approval, and some
sympathy was excited.</p>

<p>"There will be no injustice done, sir," said
the alderman. "I propose to follow up this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
matter myself. I will see my friend, Mr.
Waterbury, and I can soon learn whether the
boy's story is correct."</p>

<p>"He may lie, too!" said Vincent, who had
very good reasons for fearing Mr. Waterbury's
testimony.</p>

<p>"Mr. Waterbury is a gentleman of veracity,"
said Alderman Morris sharply. "I
see you recognize the name."</p>

<p>"Never heard of him," said Vincent. "I
suppose it is one of the boy's confederates."</p>

<p>"I will answer for him," said the alderman.
"My boy," he said, "I hope we shall be able
to prove your innocence. Be under no anxiety.
Go with the officer, and I will seek out Mr.
Waterbury. Officer, take care to treat him
gently."</p>

<p>"All right, sir."</p>

<p>There was no fear now that Tom would be
roughly treated. He had too much regard for
his own interest, and his tenure of office, to
disoblige a man so influential and powerful
as Alderman Morris.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding there had been such a turn
in his favor, Tom felt humiliated to feel that
he was under restraint, and his cheeks burned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with shame as he walked beside the officer.
Vincent, upon the other side, gnashed his teeth
with rage, as he thought of his unexpected detention.
Just as revenge was in his grasp, he
had been caught in the same trap which he
had so willingly set for Tom.</p>

<p>"That Alderman Morris is a fool!" he said.
"He isn't fit to be in office."</p>

<p>"Don't you say nothin' against him!" said
the policeman. "It won't be best for you.
He's one of our leadin' citizens, Alderman
Morris is."</p>

<p>"He snubbed you!" sneered Vincent. "He
talked to you as if you were a dog."</p>

<p>"No, he didn't. You'd better shut up, prisoner."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you're willing to be trampled
upon, it isn't any of my business. I wouldn't
stand it, alderman or no alderman. Such
things wouldn't be allowed in New York,
where I live."</p>

<p>"Oh, New York's a model city, so I've
heard," retorted the policeman, in a tone of
sarcasm. "We don't pretend to come up to
New York."</p>

<p>Finding that nothing was to be gained by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
continuing his attacks upon the alderman,
Vincent became silent; but his brain was active.
He felt that Mr. Waterbury's testimony
would be fatal to him. He must escape, if
possible. Soon a chance came. He seized his
opportunity, shook off the grasp of the officer,
and darted away. Not knowing what to do
with Tom, who was also under arrest, the officer
paused an instant, then, leaving our hero,
hastened in pursuit.</p>

<p>"Now's your chance to escape, boy!" said
a sympathetic bystander to him.</p>

<p>"I don't want to escape," answered Tom.
"I want my innocence proved. I shall stay
where I am till the officer returns."</p>

<p>And he kept his word. Ten minutes later
the officer came back, puffing and panting,
after an unsuccessful pursuit; prepared to
find Tom gone also.</p>

<p>"What, are you there?" he asked, staring
in wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom; "I don't want to escape.
I shall come out right."</p>

<p>"I believe you will," said the officer, with
a revulsion of sentiment in Tom's favor.
"Just walk along beside me, and I won't take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hold of you. I'm not afraid of your running
away now."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>TOM GETS OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> had not been long in the station-house
when Alderman Morris, accompanied by Mr.
Waterbury, entered. The latter looked at
Tom with a humorous smile.</p>

<p>"You don't appear to get along very well
without my guardianship, Tom," he said.</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered Tom. "The trouble is,
some of my other friends can't let me alone."</p>

<p>"Was it in a fit of emotional insanity that
you relieved the lady of her pocketbook?"
asked Mr. Waterbury, bent on keeping up the
joke.</p>

<p>"If I ever do such a thing, you may be sure
it is because I am insane," answered Tom positively.</p>

<p>"I shall," said Mr. Waterbury seriously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
"Now, where is this precious acquaintance
of ours who got you into this scrape?"</p>

<p>"He has escaped."</p>

<p>"Escaped!" exclaimed the alderman hastily.
"How is that?"</p>

<p>Here the policeman took up the story, and
explained that Vincent had taken advantage
of his double charge to effect his escape.</p>

<p>"I suppose, officer," said Mr. Waterbury,
"that you were unwilling to leave Tom in
order to pursue him."</p>

<p>"I did leave him, sir, and didn't expect to
find him when I got back. But there he was,
waiting for me as quietly as&mdash;anything."</p>

<p>"Didn't you feel tempted to escape, too,
my boy?"</p>

<p>"Why should I, sir? I had done nothing;
I had nothing to fear."</p>

<p>"Innocence is not always a protection, for
justice is sometimes far from clear-sighted.
In the present case, however, I think you will
not suffer for your confidence."</p>

<p>Tom was not brought to trial. Mr. Waterbury's
statement of what had passed on the
voyage of the <i>River Belle</i> was held to be sufficient
to establish Tom's innocence, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
was allowed to walk out with Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to do this morning,
Tom?" asked his friend.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then come around and dine with me at
the Burnet House. Afterward we will call
upon your friends, the Watsons."</p>

<p>Mrs. Watson and Jennie had altered their
plans and gone to a boarding-house, preferring
that to a hotel.</p>

<p>"That will be agreeable to me, sir."</p>

<p>The dinner was excellent, and Tom did full
justice to it.</p>

<p>"At one time this morning, Tom, it looked
as if you would dine at quite a different place,"
said Mr. Waterbury, when they were eating
the dessert.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You won't think much of Cincinnati's
hospitality, eh, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Any place would be the same, where Vincent
was," returned Tom.</p>

<p>"Very true; he and Graham will bring discredit
on any city which they adopt as a home.
How long shall you remain here?"</p>

<p>"I should like to stay long enough to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
something of the city, but I cannot afford it.
I must reach California as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"No doubt you are right, in your circumstances.
I have been inquiring for you, and
find that St. Joseph, in Missouri, is the usual
starting-point for travelers across the plains.
I find an acquaintance here in the hotel, who
will start to-morrow for that place. I have
mentioned you to him, and he says he shall
be glad to have your company so far. Whether
you keep together afterward will depend upon
yourselves."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to have company, sir," said
Tom. Though manly and self-reliant, he realized
that it was quite a serious undertaking
for a boy of his age to make the trip alone.
He was not sure of meeting with another
friend like Mr. Waterbury, and there might
be danger of falling in with another brace of
worthies like Graham and Vincent.</p>

<p>"My friend's name is Ferguson&mdash;a Scotchman,
rather sedate, but entirely trustworthy.
I will introduce you this evening."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>After dinner they walked to Mrs. Watson's
boarding-house. Somewhere on Vine Street,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Mr. Waterbury paused in front of a jewelry
store.</p>

<p>"I want to step in here a minute, Tom," he
said.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>Tom remained near the door, while Mr.
Waterbury went into the back part of the
store, where he was occupied for a few minutes
with one of the proprietors. When
he came back he held a small box in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Please carry this for me, Tom," he said.</p>

<p>"With pleasure, sir."</p>

<p>They went out into the street together.</p>

<p>"Do you know what is in the box, Tom?"
asked Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered our hero, a little surprised
at the question.</p>

<p>"You didn't see what I was buying, then?"
continued Mr. Waterbury.</p>

<p>"No, sir; I was watching the crowds on
the sidewalk."</p>

<p>"If you have any curiosity, you may open
the box."</p>

<p>Previously Tom had felt no curiosity. Now
he did feel a little.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Opening the box, his eye rested on a neat
silver watch, with a chain attached. The case
was a pretty one, and Tom glanced at it with
approval.</p>

<p>"It is very pretty, sir," he said; "but I
thought you had a watch already."</p>

<p>"I didn't buy it for myself."</p>

<p>"For your son?" asked Tom innocently.</p>

<p>Mr. Waterbury smiled.</p>

<p>"I thought of asking your acceptance of
it," he said.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you are going to give
it to me, sir?" said Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>"If you will accept it."</p>

<p>"How kind you are, Mr. Waterbury!" exclaimed
Tom gratefully. "There is nothing
in the world that I should like so much. How
can I thank you?"</p>

<p>"By considering it a proof of my interest
in you. I was sure you would like it. Before
I had reached your age the great object of my
ambition was a watch. I received one from
my uncle, as a gift, on my seventeenth birthday.
I believe I looked at it once in five minutes
on an average during the first day."</p>

<p>"I dare say it will be so with me, sir," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Tom, who, at the moment, had the watch in his
hand, examining it.</p>

<p>"As you are to rough it, I thought it best
to get you a hunting-case watch, because it
will be less liable to injury. When you become
a man I hope you will be prosperous
enough to buy a gold watch and chain, if you
prefer them. While you are a boy silver will
be good enough."</p>

<p>"Gold wouldn't correspond very well with
my circumstances," said Tom. "I didn't
dream of even having a silver watch and chain
for years to come. I shall write home this
evening, and tell mother of my good luck."</p>

<p>"Will you mention that you have already
been under arrest?" asked Mr. Waterbury,
smiling.</p>

<p>Tom shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am not proud of that," he answered;
"and it would only trouble them at home to
have an account of it. When I get home, I
may mention it sometime."</p>

<p>"Better put on your watch and chain, Tom,
before we reach Mrs. Watson's."</p>

<p>Tom needed no second invitation.</p>

<p>"It's lucky mother put a watch-pocket in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
my vest," he said. "We didn't either of us
suppose there would be any occasion for it;
but I asked her to do it."</p>

<p>In a nice-looking brick boarding-house&mdash;for
brown-stone houses were not then often to be
found&mdash;Tom and his friend found Mrs. Watson
and Jennie.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad to see you, Tom," said Jennie.
"I've missed you awfully."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom. "I've come to bid
you good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by! You don't mean that?"</p>

<p>"I expect to start for St. Joseph to-morrow.
I am in a hurry to get to California."</p>

<p>"That's real mean. I don't see why you
can't stay in Cincinnati a week."</p>

<p>"I should like to."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you?" persisted the young
girl.</p>

<p>"Jennie," said her mother, "we must remember
that Thomas is not traveling for
pleasure. He is going to California to seek
his fortune. It won't do for him to linger on
his way."</p>

<p>"A week won't make much difference; will
it, Tom?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid it will, Jennie. Besides, a
friend of Mr. Waterbury will start to-morrow,
and has agreed to take me with him."</p>

<p>"I suppose you've got to go, then," said
Jennie regretfully. "Oh, where did you get
that watch, Tom?"</p>

<p>"A kind friend gave it to me."</p>

<p>"Who do you mean&mdash;Mr. Graham?" she
asked archly.</p>

<p>"He would be more likely to relieve me of
it. No, it is Mr. Waterbury."</p>

<p>"I am going to kiss you for that, Mr. Waterbury,"
said Jennie impulsively; and she suited
the action to the word.</p>

<p>"What will Mr. Waterbury think, Jennie?"
said her mother.</p>

<p>"He thinks himself well repaid for his
gift," answered that gentleman, smiling; "and
half inclined to give Tom another watch."</p>

<p>"Isn't it my turn, now?" asked Tom, with
a courage at which he afterward rather
wondered; but he was fast getting rid of his
country bashfulness.</p>

<p>"I never kiss boys," said Jennie demurely.</p>

<p>"Then I will grow into a man as fast as I
can," said Tom, "and give somebody a watch,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and then&mdash;&mdash; But that will be a good while
to wait."</p>

<p>"I may kiss you good-by," said Jennie, "if
I feel like it."</p>

<p>She did feel like it, and Tom received the
kiss.</p>

<p>"It strikes me, Tom," said Mr. Waterbury,
as they were walking home, "that you and
Jennie are getting along fast."</p>

<p>"She kissed you first," said Tom, blushing.</p>

<p>"But the kiss she gave me was wholly on
your account."</p>

<p>"She seems just like a sister," said Tom.
"She's a tip-top girl."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>A MISSOURI TAVERN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Tom started on his way. His
new companion, Donald Ferguson, was a sedate
Scotchman, and a thoroughly reliable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
man. He was possessed to the full of the frugality
characteristic of the race to which he
belonged, and, being more accustomed to traveling
than Tom, saved our hero something in
the matter of expense. He was always ready
to talk of Scotland, which he evidently thought
the finest country in the world. He admitted
that Glasgow was not as large a city as London,
but that it was more attractive. As for
New York, that city bore no comparison to the
chief city of Scotland.</p>

<p>"You must go to Scotland some time, Tom,"
he said. "If you can't visit but one country
in the Old World, go to Scotland."</p>

<p>Privately Tom was of opinion that he
should prefer to visit England; but he did not
venture to hurt the feelings of his fellow-traveler
by saying so.</p>

<p>"I wonder, Mr. Ferguson," he could not
help saying one day, "that you should have
been willing to leave Scotland, since you so
much prefer it to America."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, my lad," answered the Scotchman.
"I would rather live in Scotland than
anywhere else on God's footstool; but I won't
be denying that it is a poor place for a man to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
make money, if compared with a new country
like this."</p>

<p>"There are no gold-mines, I suppose,
sir?"</p>

<p>"No; and the land is not as rich as the land
here. It is rich in historical associations; but
a man, you know, can't live on those," he added
shrewdly.</p>

<p>"No, I should think not," said Tom. "It
would be pretty dry diet. How long have you
been in the country, Mr. Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"A matter of three months only, my lad.
It's the gold-mines that brought me over. I
read of them in the papers at home, and I took
the first ship across the Atlantic."</p>

<p>"Have you a family, Mr. Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"I've got an old mother at home, my lad,
who looks to me for support. I left fifty
pounds with her when I came away. It'll last
her, I'm thinkin', till I can send her some
from California."</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Ferguson, you are like me," said
Tom. "I am going to California to work for
my father and mother. Father is poor, and I
have brothers and sisters at home to provide
for. I hope I shall succeed, for their sake."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will, my lad," said the Scotchman,
in a tone of calm confidence. "It is a noble
purpose, and if you keep to it God will bless
you in your undertaking, and give you a good
fortune."</p>

<p>"I hope we shall both be fortunate."</p>

<p>"I have no fear. I put my trust in the
Lord, who is always ready to help those who
are working for him."</p>

<p>Tom found that Mr. Ferguson, though his
manner was dry and unattractive, was a religious
man, and he respected and esteemed him
for his excellent traits. He was not a man
to inspire warm affection, but no one could
fail to respect him. He felt that he was fortunate
in having such a man for his companion,
and he was glad that Mr. Ferguson appeared
to like him in turn.</p>

<p>He also found that the Scotchman, though
a man of peace, and very much averse to
quarreling, was by no means deficient in the
trait of personal courage.</p>

<p>One evening they arrived at a small tavern
in a Missouri town. Neither Tom nor his
companion particularly liked the appearance
of the place nor its frequenters, but it appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to be the only place of entertainment in the
settlement.</p>

<p>The barroom, which was the only public
room set apart for the use of the guests, was
the resort of a party of drunken roisterers,
who were playing poker in the corner, and betting
on the game. At the elbow of each player
was set a glass of whisky, and the end of
each game was marked by a fresh glass all
around.</p>

<p>Tom and Mr. Ferguson took a walk after
supper, and then sat down quietly at a little
distance from the card-players, attracting at
first but little attention from them.</p>

<p>Presently, at the close of a game, glasses
were ordered for the party, at the expense of
those who had suffered defeat.</p>

<p>"What'll you have, strangers?" inquired
a tipsy fellow, with an Indian complexion and
long black hair, staggering toward Ferguson.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said the Scotchman;
"but I don't drink."</p>

<p>"Don't drink!" exclaimed the former, in
evident surprise. "What sort of a man, pray,
may you be?"</p>

<p>"I am a temperance man," said Ferguson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
adding indiscreetly, "and it would be well for
you all if you would shun the vile liquor which
is destroying soul and body."</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash; your impudence!" ejaculated the
other, in a rage. "Do you dare to insult
gentlemen like us?"</p>

<p>"I never insult anybody," said the Scotchman
calmly. "What I have said is for your
good, and you would admit it if you were
sober."</p>

<p>"Do you dare to say I'm drunk?" demanded
the man, in a fury.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferguson," said Tom, in a low voice,
"I wouldn't provoke him if I were you."</p>

<p>But the Scotchman was no coward, and,
though generally prudent, he was too fond of
argument to yield the point.</p>

<p>"Of course, you're drunk," he said calmly.
"If you will reflect, you show all the signs of
a man that has taken too much liquor. Your
face is flushed, your hand is unsteady, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a volley of execrations
from the man whom he was coolly describing,
and the latter, in a fit of fury, struck
the Scotchman in the face. Had the blow been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
well directed it would, for the time, have
marred the small share of personal beauty
with which nature had endowed Mr. Ferguson;
but it glanced aside and just struck him
on his prominent cheek-bone.</p>

<p>"A ring! a ring!" shouted the men in the
corner, jumping to their feet in excitement.
"Let Jim and the Scotchman fight it out."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Mr. Ferguson, "I don't
wish to fight with your friend. He is drunk,
as you can see plainly enough. I don't wish
to fight with a drunken man."</p>

<p>"Who says I am drunk?" demanded the
champion of whisky. "Let me get at
him."</p>

<p>But his friends were now holding him back.
They wanted to see a square fight, according
to rule. It would prove, in their opinion, a
pleasant little excitement.</p>

<p>"I meant no offense," said Ferguson; "I
only told the truth."</p>

<p>"You are a &mdash;&mdash; liar!" exclaimed the man,
known as Jim.</p>

<p>"I do not heed the words of a man in your
condition," said the Scotchman calmly.</p>

<p>"Pull his nose, Jim! Make him fight!" exclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the friends of the bully. "We'll back
you!"</p>

<p>The hint was taken. Jim staggered forward,
and, seizing the Scotchman's prominent
nose, gave it a violent tweak.</p>

<p>Now there are few men, with or without
self-respect, who can calmly submit to an insult
like this. Certainly Mr. Donald Ferguson
was not one of them. The color mantled his
high cheek-bones, and anger gained dominion
over him. He sprang to his feet, grasped the
bully in his strong arms, dashed him backward
upon the floor of the barroom, and, turning
to the companions of the fallen man, he said,
"Now come on, if you want to fight. I'll take
you one by one, and fight the whole of you, if
you like."</p>

<p>Instead of being angry, they applauded his
pluck. They cared little for the fate of their
champion, but were impressed by the evident
strength of the stranger.</p>

<p>"Stranger," said one of them, "you've
proved that you're a man of honor. We
thought you were a coward. It's a pity you
don't drink. What may your name be?"</p>

<p>"Donald Ferguson."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, boys, here's to the health of Mr.
Ferguson. He's a bully boy, and no coward."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the Scotchman, "it's a
compliment you mean, no doubt, and I'm suitably
thankful. If you'll allow me, I'll drink
your health in a liquor which will not injure
any one. I'll wish you health and prosperity
in a glass of cold water, if the barkeeper
happens to have any of that beverage handy.
Tom, join with me in the toast."</p>

<p>Tom did so, and the speech was well received.</p>

<p>"As for this gentleman," said Mr. Ferguson,
addressing Jim, who had struggled to
his feet, and was surveying the scene in rather
a bewildered way, "I hope he won't harbor
malice; I've only got even with him. We may
as well forgive and forget."</p>

<p>"That's the talk! Jim, drink the stranger's
health!"</p>

<p>Jim looked a little doubtful, but when a
glass of whisky was put into his hand he could
not resist the seductive draft, and tossed it
down.</p>

<p>"Now shake hands!" said one of the
players.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"With all my heart," said Ferguson, and
the two shook hands, to the great delight of
the company.</p>

<p>"You got off pretty well, Mr. Ferguson,"
said Tom, when they retired for the night.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lad, better than I expected. I
thought once I would have to fight the whole
pack. Poor fellows! I pity them. They are
but slaves to their appetites. I hope, my lad,
you'll never yield to a like temptation."</p>

<p>"No fear for me, Mr. Ferguson. I feel as
you do on the subject."</p>

<p>The journey continued till one day, about
noon, they reached the town of St, Joseph,
popularly called St. Joe.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>ST. JOE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">St. Joe</span> was at that time the fitting-out
point for overland parties bound for California.
As a matter of course it presented a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
busy, bustling appearance, and seemed full
of life and movement. There was a large transient
population, of a very miscellaneous character.
It included the thrifty, industrious
emigrant, prepared to work hard and live
poorly, till the hoped-for competence was attained;
but there was also the shiftless adventurer,
whose chief object was to live without
work, and the unscrupulous swindler, who
was ready, if opportunity offered, to appropriate
the hard earnings of others.</p>

<p>"It's a lively place, Mr. Ferguson," said
Tom.</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, my young friend," said the
cautious Scot; "but it is a place, to my thinking,
where it behooves a man to look well to
his purse."</p>

<p>"No doubt you are right, Mr. Ferguson. I
have learned to be cautious since my adventure
with Graham and Vincent."</p>

<p>"There's many like them in the world, Tom.
They are like lions, going about seeking whom
they may devour."</p>

<p>St. Joseph could not at that time boast any
first-class hotels. Inns and lodging-houses it
had in plenty. At one of these&mdash;a two-story<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
building, dignified by the title of "The Pacific
Hotel"&mdash;our hero and his Scotch friend found
accommodations. They were charged two dollars
and a half per day&mdash;the same price they
charged at first-class hotels in New York and
Boston, while their rooms and fare were very
far from luxurious. The landlord was a stout,
jolly host, with a round, good-natured face.</p>

<p>"You and your son will room together, I
suppose," he said.</p>

<p>"He isn't my son, but a young friend of
mine," said Mr. Ferguson.</p>

<p>"I thought he didn't look much like you,"
said the landlord.</p>

<p>"I am hard and weather-beaten, while he is
young and fresh."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, I wish you both good
luck. What will you take? I have a superior
article of whisky that I can recommend."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I beg you will excuse me,
sir," said Ferguson. "I never drink."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Tom; "but I am much
obliged to you all the same."</p>

<p>"Well, that beats me," said the landlord.
"Why, you don't know what's good. You ain't
a minister, are you?" turning to Ferguson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have not that high distinction, my friend.
I am an unworthy member of the church of
Scotland."</p>

<p>"I don't think your countrymen generally
refuse whisky."</p>

<p>"So much the worse for them. They are
only too fond of it. My own brother died a
miserable death, brought on by his love of
liquor."</p>

<p>"Then I won't press you; but I say,
strangers, you won't find many of your way of
thinking in the country you're going to."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt he's right, Tom," said Ferguson
to Tom, as they entered the chamber assigned
to them. "We may not be together always.
I hope you won't be led away by them
that offer you strong drink. It would be the
ruin of you, boy."</p>

<p>"Don't fear for me, Mr. Ferguson. I have
no taste for it."</p>

<p>"Sometimes it's hard to refuse."</p>

<p>"It won't be hard for me."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say that, my lad.
You are young, strong, and industrious.
You'll succeed, I'll warrant, if you steer clear
of that quicksand."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Later in the day the two friends began to
make inquiries about overland travel. They
had no wish to remain long at St. Joe. Both
were impatient to reach the land of gold, and
neither cared to incur the expense of living
at the hotel any longer than was absolutely
necessary. Luckily this probably would not
be long, for nearly every day a caravan set
out on the long journey, and doubtless they
would be able to join on agreeing to pay their
share of the expenses. It was a great undertaking,
for the distance to be traversed
was over two thousand miles, through an unsettled
country, some of it a desert, with the
chances of an attack by hostile Indians, and the
certainty of weeks, and perhaps months, of
privation and fatigue. Mr. Donald Ferguson
looked forward to it with some apprehension;
for, with characteristic Scotch caution, he
counted the cost of whatever he undertook, and
did not fail to set before his mind all the contingencies
and dangers attending it.</p>

<p>"It's a long journey we're going on, my
lad," he said, "and we may not reach the end
of it in safety."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't best to worry about that, Mr. Ferguson,"
said Tom cheerfully.</p>

<p>"You are right, my lad. It's not for the
best to worry, but it is well to make provision
for what may happen. Now, if anything happens
to me, I am minded to make you my executor."</p>

<p>"But don't you think I am too young,
Mr. Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"You are o'er young, I grant, but you are a
lad of good parts, temperate, steady, and
honest. I have no other friend I feel like
trusting."</p>

<p>"I hope, Mr. Ferguson, there will be no
occasion to render you any such service, but
whatever I can I will do."</p>

<p>"It will be very simple. You will take my
money, and see that it is sent to my mother,
in Glasgow. I will give you her address now,
and then, if any sudden fate overtakes me,
there will be no trouble. You will know just
what to do."</p>

<p>Tom was flattered by this mark of confidence.
It was evident that the cautious
Scotchman had formed a very favorable opin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>ion
of him, or he would not have selected so
young a boy for so important a trust.</p>

<p>"Will you do the same for me, Mr.
Ferguson?" he asked, with the sudden reflection
that, young as he was, there was no
absolute certainty of his living to reach
California.</p>

<p>"Surely I will, my lad."</p>

<p>"If I should die I should want any money
I might have left sent to my father."</p>

<p>"Give me his address, my lad, and it shall
be done. It is a good precaution, and we
shan't either of us die the sooner for doing
our duty, to the best of our ability, by those
who would mourn our loss."</p>

<p>Tom and his friend instituted inquiries, and
ascertained that two days later a caravan
was to start on its way across the continent.
They ascertained, also, that the leader of the
expedition was a pioneer named Fletcher, who
was making his home at the California Hotel.
They made their way thither, and were fortunate
enough to find Mr. Fletcher at home. He
was a stout, broad-shouldered man, a practical
farmer, who was emigrating from Illinois.
Unlike the majority of emigrants, he had his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
family with him, namely, a wife, and four
children, the oldest a boy of twelve.</p>

<p>"My friend," said Ferguson, "I hear that
you are soon leaving here with a party for
California."</p>

<p>"I leave day after to-morrow," answered
Fletcher.</p>

<p>"Is your party wholly made up?"</p>

<p>"We are about full; but we might receive
one or two more."</p>

<p>"My young friend and I wish to join some
good party, as we cannot afford to remain
here, and we are anxious to get to work as
soon as possible."</p>

<p>Some care needed to be exercised in the
choice of a party, as there were some who
would only give trouble and annoyance, or
perhaps fail to pay their proper share of the
expenses. But Ferguson's appearance was
sufficient guarantee of his reliability, and no
one was likely to object to Tom.</p>

<p>"Of course," added Ferguson, "we are
ready to bear our share of the expense."</p>

<p>"Then you can come," said Fletcher. "You
will both need revolvers, for we may be attacked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
by Indians, and must be able to defend
ourselves."</p>

<p>"Certainly, we will do our part, if need
be."</p>

<p>This was an expense which Tom had not
foreseen; but he at once saw the importance
of being armed when crossing such a country
as lay before them, and went with Ferguson
to make the needful purchase. His Scotch
friend instructed him in the method of using
his new weapon, and Tom felt a boy's natural
pride in his new acquisition. He felt years
older then he did on the morning when he left
his country home. He had gained some
knowledge of the world, and felt a greater
confidence in himself on that account. He
looked forward to the remainder of his journey
with pleasurable excitement, and lost no time
in making the necessary preparations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>HOW THINGS WENT ON AT HOME.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Tom was slowly making his way
westward, there was one place where tidings
from him were anxiously awaited, and where
nightly prayers were offered for his health
and safe progress. Of course this was the
dear, though humble, farmhouse, which had
been his home.</p>

<p>Twice a week Tom wrote, and his letters
were cheerful and reassuring.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Don't trouble yourself about me, dear
mother"&mdash;he wrote from Cincinnati. "I am
making friends, and learning how to travel. I
feel years older, and rely much more on myself
than when, an inexperienced boy, I bade you
good-by. I am a thousand miles from you,
and the longest and most difficult part of the
journey lies before me; but with health and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
strength, and prudence, I hope to arrive in
good condition at my destination. As to health
I never felt better in my life, and I have taken
lessons in prudence and caution which will be
of essential service to me. I have found that
a boy who goes out into the world to seek his
fortune cannot trust everybody he falls in
with. He will find foes as well as friends, and
he will need to be on his guard.</p>

<p>"I start to-morrow for St. Joseph, in Missouri,
going by way of St. Louis. Mr. Donald
Ferguson, a middle-aged Scotchman, is my
companion. A younger and livelier companion
might prove more agreeable, but perhaps not
so safe. Mr. Ferguson is old enough to be
my father, and I shall be guided by his judgment
where my own is at fault. He is very
frugal, as I believe his countrymen generally
are, and that, of course, just suits me. I don't
know how long I shall be in reaching St.
Joseph, but I shall write you once or twice on
the way. Give my love to father, Sarah,
Walter, and Harry, and keep a great deal for
yourself.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"Your loving son,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Tom.</span>"<br />
</div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tom is growing manly, Mary," said Mark
Nelson to his wife. "It's doing him good to
see a little of the world."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is, Mark," said his wife; "but
the more I think of it the more I feel that he
is very young to undertake such a long journey
alone."</p>

<p>"He is young, but it will make a man of
him."</p>

<p>"He must be having a tip-top time," said
Walter; "I wish I were with him."</p>

<p>"You would be more of a hindrance than
a help to him, Walter," said Mark Nelson.</p>

<p>"You are only a child, you know," said
Sarah, in an elder-sister tone.</p>

<p>"What do you call yourself?" retorted
Walter. "You are only two years older than
I am."</p>

<p>"Girls always know more than boys of the
same age," said Sarah condescendingly. "Besides,
I haven't said anything about going out
to California."</p>

<p>"No, I should think not. A girl that's
afraid of a mouse had better stay at home."</p>

<p>Walter referred to an incident of the day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
previous, when the sudden appearance of a
mouse threw Sarah into a panic.</p>

<p>"Are there any mouses in California?"
asked little Harry, with interest.</p>

<p>"If there are I could carry a cat with me,"
returned Sarah good-humoredly.</p>

<p>Mark Nelson, though he felt Tom was a boy
to be trusted, did ask himself occasionally
whether he had been wise in permitting him
to leave home under the circumstances. Suppose
he continued in health, there were doubts
of his success. His golden dreams might not
be realized. The two hundred dollars which
he had raised for Tom might be lost, and bring
in no return; and this would prove a serious
loss to Mark, hampered as he was already by a
heavy mortgage on his farm. Would Squire
Hudson be forbearing, if ill-luck came? This
was a question he could not answer. He only
knew that such was not the squire's reputation.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Nelson, what do you hear from
Tom," asked the squire, one day about this
time. "How far is he on his way?"</p>

<p>"We received a letter from Cincinnati<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
yesterday. He then was about starting for
St. Joseph."</p>

<p>"Does he seem to enjoy the journey?"</p>

<p>"He writes in excellent spirits. He says he
has met with good friends."</p>

<p>"Indeed! How does his money hold out?"</p>

<p>"He does not speak of that."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I dare say he is getting along
well;" and the squire walked on.</p>

<p>"Does he feel interested in Tom, or not?"
queried Mark Nelson, as he looked thoughtfully
after the squire, as he walked on with
stately steps, leaning slightly on his gold-headed
cane. He might have been enlightened
on this point, if he could have heard a conversation,
later in the day, between Squire
Hudson and his son Sinclair.</p>

<p>"I saw Mark Nelson this morning," he observed
at the supper table.</p>

<p>"Has he heard from Tom?"</p>

<p>"Yes; his son wrote him from Cincinnati."</p>

<p>"I wish I could go to Cincinnati," grumbled
Sinclair; "I think I have a better right to see
the world than Tom Nelson."</p>

<p>"All in good time, my son. Tom is not
traveling for pleasure."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Still, he is getting the pleasure."</p>

<p>"He will have to work hard when he reaches
California. Probably he won't have a cent
left when he gets there."</p>

<p>"What will he do then?"</p>

<p>"He must earn money."</p>

<p>"Do you think he will do well, father?"</p>

<p>"He may, and then again he may not,"
answered the squire judicially.</p>

<p>"If he don't, how is he going to pay you
back the money you lent him?"</p>

<p>"I always thought your father was foolish
to lend his money to a boy like that," said
Mrs. Hudson querulously.</p>

<p>"Women know nothing about business,"
said the squire, with an air of superior wisdom.</p>

<p>"Sometimes men don't know much," retorted
his wife.</p>

<p>"If you refer to me, Mrs. Hudson," said
her husband, "you need have no anxiety. I
did not lend the money to the boy, but to his
father."</p>

<p>"That isn't much better. Everybody knows
that Mark Nelson has all that he can do to get
along. His wife hasn't had a new dress for
years."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The squire's face grew hard and stern. He
had never loved his wife, and never forgiven
Mrs. Nelson, whom he had loved as much as
he was capable of doing, for refusing his
hand.</p>

<p>"She has made her bed and she must lie
upon it," he said curtly. "She might have
known that Mark Nelson would never be able
to provide for her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she never had any other offer,"
said Mrs. Hudson, who was ignorant of a certain
passage of her husband's life.</p>

<p>"Probably she did, for she was a very pretty
girl."</p>

<p>"Then she's faded," said Mrs. Hudson, tossing
her head.</p>

<p>Squire Hudson did not reply; but as his eyes
rested on the sharp, querulous face of his helpmate,
and he compared it mentally with the
pleasant face of Mrs. Nelson, he said to himself
that, faded or not, the latter was still
better looking than his wife had been in the
days of her youth. Of course it would not do
to say so, for Mrs. Hudson was not amiable.</p>

<p>"Mark Nelson has given me security," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the squire, returning to the point under discussion.
"I hold a mortgage on his farm
for the whole amount he owes me."</p>

<p>"Do you think you shall have to foreclose,
father?" asked Sinclair.</p>

<p>"If Tom does not succeed in California, I
probably shall," said the squire.</p>

<p>"Do you think he will succeed?"</p>

<p>"He may be able to make a living, but I
don't think he will be able to help his father
any."</p>

<p>"Then why did you lend him the money?"</p>

<p>"He wanted to go, and was willing to take
the risk. I lent the money as a business operation."</p>

<p>"Suppose Mr. Nelson loses his farm, what
will he do?" inquired Sinclair.</p>

<p>"I really don't know," answered the squire,
shrugging his shoulders. "That is no concern
of mine."</p>

<p>"Tom wouldn't put on so many airs if his
father had to go to the poorhouse," said Sinclair.</p>

<p>"Does he put on airs?"</p>

<p>"He seems to think he is as good as I am,"
said Squire Hudson's heir.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is perfectly ridiculous," said Mrs.
Hudson. "The boy must be a fool."</p>

<p>"He is no fool," said the squire, who did not
allow prejudice to carry him so far as his
wife and son. "He is a boy of very fair
abilities; but I apprehend he will find it harder
to make his fortune than he anticipated.
However, time will show."</p>

<p>"Most likely he'll come home in rags, and
grow up a day-laborer," said Sinclair complacently.
"When I'm a rich man I'll give
him work. He won't feel like putting on airs,
then."</p>

<p>"What a good heart Sinclair has!" said
Mrs. Hudson admiringly.</p>

<p>Squire Hudson said nothing. Possibly the
goodness of his son's heart was not so
manifest to him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>THE YOUNG MAN FROM BOSTON.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after leaving St. Joe, the emigrant
train which Tom had joined, entered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
territory of Kansas. At that early day the
settlement of this now prosperous State had
scarcely begun. Its rich soil was as yet unvexed
by the plow and the spade, and the tall
prairie grass and virgin forest stretched for
many and many a mile westward in undisturbed
loneliness.</p>

<p>One afternoon, toward the setting of the
sun, the caravan halted on the site of the
present capital of the State, Topeka. The patient
oxen, wearied with the twenty miles they
had traveled, were permitted to graze. The
ten baggage wagons or "ships of the plain," as
they were sometimes called&mdash;came to anchor
in a sea of verdure. They were ranged in a
circle, the interior space being occupied as a
camping-ground. Then began preparations
for supper. Some of the party were sent for
water. A fire was built, and the travelers, with
a luxurious enjoyment of rest, sank upon the
grass.</p>

<p>Donald Ferguson looked thoughtfully over
the vast expanse of unsettled prairie, and said
to Tom, "It's a great country, Tom. There
seems no end to it."</p>

<p>"That's the way I felt when I was plodding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
along to-day through the mud," said Tom,
laughing.</p>

<p>"It's because the soil is so rich," said the
Scotchman. "It'll be a great farming country
some day, I'm thinking."</p>

<p>"I suppose the soil isn't so rich in Scotland,
Mr. Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"No, my lad. It's rocky and barren, and
covered with dry heather; but it produces rare
men, for all that."</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson was patriotic to the backbone.
He would not claim for Scotland what she
could not fairly claim; but he was all ready
with some compensating claim.</p>

<p>"How do you stand the walking, Mr.
Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"I'm getting used to it."</p>

<p>"Then it's more than I am. I think it's
beastly."</p>

<p>These words were not uttered by Tom, but
by rather a dandified-looking young man, who
came up limping. He was from Boston, and
gave his name as Lawrence Peabody. He had
always lived in Boston, where he had been
employed in various genteel avocations; but
in an evil hour he had been lured from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
comfortable home by the seductive cry of gold,
and, laying down his yardstick, had set out
for California across the plains. He was a
slender young man, with limbs better fitted for
dancing than for tramping across the prairie,
and he felt bitterly the fatigue of the journey.</p>

<p>"Are you tired, Mr. Peabody?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I am just about dead. I didn't bargain for
walking all the way across the prairies. Why
couldn't old Fletcher let me ride?"</p>

<p>"The oxen have had all they could do to-day
to draw the wagons through the mud."</p>

<p>"Look at those boots," said the Bostonian
ruefully, pointing to a pair of light calfskin
boots, which were so overlaid with mud that
it was hard to tell what was their original
color. "I bought those boots in Boston only
two weeks ago. Everybody called them stylish.
Now they are absolutely disreputable."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, my friend," said the
Scotchman, "that you did not show much
sagacity in selecting such boots for your journey.
My young friend, Tom, is much better
provided."</p>

<p>"His boots are cowhide," said Mr. Lawrence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Peabody disdainfully. "Do you think I
would wear cowhide boots?"</p>

<p>"You would find them more serviceable, Mr.
Peabody," said Tom. "Besides, I don't believe
anybody could tell the difference now."</p>

<p>"How much did you pay for them?" asked
the Bostonian.</p>

<p>"A dollar and a half."</p>

<p>"Humph! I thought so," returned Peabody
contemptuously. "We don't wear cowhide
boots in Boston."</p>

<p>"You are not in Boston now."</p>

<p>"I wish I was," said Peabody energetically.
"I wouldn't have started if I had known what
was before me. I expected to travel like a
gentleman, instead of wading through this
cursed mud till I'm ready to drop. Look at
my pantaloons, all splashed with mire. What
would my friends say if I should appear in this
rig on Washington Street?"</p>

<p>"They might take you for a bog-trotter,"
said Tom, smiling.</p>

<p>"I have always been particular about my
appearance," said Peabody plaintively. "'He
looks just as if he'd come out of a bandbox,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
some of my lady friends used to say. How do
I look now?"</p>

<p>"Like a dirty-handed son of toil," said Tom
humorously.</p>

<p>"So do you," retorted Peabody, who felt
that this was uncomplimentary.</p>

<p>"I admit it," said Tom; "and that's just
what I expect to be. You don't expect to dig
gold with kid gloves on, do you, Mr. Peabody?"</p>

<p>"I wish I had brought some with me," said
the Bostonian seriously. "It would have saved
my hands looking so dingy."</p>

<p>"How came you to start for California, my
friend?" inquired Ferguson.</p>

<p>"The fact is," said Peabody, "I am not rich.
There are members of our family who are
wealthy; but I am not one of the lucky
number."</p>

<p>"You were making a living at home, were
you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but my income was only enough for
myself."</p>

<p>"I suppose you were in love, then," said
Tom.</p>

<p>"I don't mind saying that I was; confidentially,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of course," said Mr. Peabody complacently.</p>

<p>"Was your love returned?"</p>

<p>"I may say it was. The young lady was the
daughter of a merchant prince. I saw that
she loved me, but her father would not consent
to our union, on account of my limited means.
I read in the <i>Transcript</i> of the gold discoveries
in California. I determined to go out there,
and try my fortune. If I am successful I will
go home, and, with a bag of gold in each hand,
demand the hand of Matilda from her haughty
sire. When he asks me for my credentials, I
will point to the gold, and say, 'Behold them
here!'"</p>

<p>"If both your hands are full I don't see how
you can point to the bags of gold," said Tom,
who liked to tease the young Bostonian.</p>

<p>"There are a great many things you don't
understand," said Mr. Peabody, irritably.</p>

<p>"He is right, Tom," said Ferguson, with a
quiet smile.</p>

<p>"If you are both against me, I will give it
up," said Tom. "All I can say is, I hope you'll
get the two bags of gold, Mr. Peabody, and
that you'll get the young lady, too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Fletcher came up, and called upon
Tom to assist in preparations for supper. Our
hero readily complied with the request. Indeed,
he always showed himself so obliging
that he won the favorable regards of all.</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody continued the conversation
with Mr. Ferguson.</p>

<p>"Do you think there's as much gold in California
as people say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," answered the Scotchman.</p>

<p>"You don't?" ejaculated the Bostonian, in
dismay.</p>

<p>"No; people always magnify when they talk
of a new country. Now, my friend, how much
do you expect to get in the first year?"</p>

<p>"Well, about fifty thousand dollars," answered
Peabody.</p>

<p>"And how much were you earning in
Boston&mdash;a thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"About that," answered Peabody vaguely.
In fact, he had been working on a salary of
twelve dollars a week, in a retail dry-goods
store on Washington Street.</p>

<p>"Then you expect to make fifty times as
much as at home?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think I will?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have never had such large expectations.
If I make three or four thousand dollars in
twelve months it will satisfy me."</p>

<p>"But a man would never get rich, at that
rate," said Lawrence Peabody uneasily.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. It depends as
much on what a man does with his money, as
on the amount he makes," said the prudent
Scot.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I did wrong in leaving Boston,"
said Peabody gloomily. "If I am to
travel many weeks through the mud, and get
no more than that, I shall feel that I am poorly
paid."</p>

<p>"You don't feel like my young friend Tom.
He is full of hope, and enjoys everything."</p>

<p>"He hasn't been brought up as I have," said
Peabody. "A country boy in cowhide boots
is tough, and don't mind roughing it."</p>

<p>Ferguson did not have a chance to answer,
for there was a summons to supper&mdash;a welcome
call, that made even Mr. Lawrence
Peabody look cheerful for the time being.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>MR. PEABODY'S TROUBLES.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the party camped for the night the
custom was to arrange the baggage wagons in
a semicircle, and provide a resting-place for
the women and children inside. As they were
passing through a country occupied by Indians
it was necessary to post one or more sentinels
to keep watch through the night, and give notice
of any who might be seen lurking near the
camp. Fortunately, however, an Indian attack
was seldom made at night. The time
generally selected was in the morning, when
the party were preparing to start on their
day's march. Tom, as a boy, would have been
excused taking his turn; but this did not suit
him. He requested as a favor, that he might
stand watch with the rest.</p>

<p>"Can he be relied upon? Is he not too
young?" asked Fletcher, the leader, of Mr.
Ferguson.</p>

<p>"You can depend upon him," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Scotchman confidently. "There's more manliness
in Tom than in many men of twice his
years."</p>

<p>"Then I will put his name on the list," said
Fletcher.</p>

<p>"That's right. I'll answer for him."</p>

<p>But there was one of the travelers who was
by no means eager to stand on watch. This
was Lawrence Peabody, the young man from
Boston. He sought an interview with Fletcher,
and asked to be excused.</p>

<p>"On what grounds, Mr. Peabody?" asked
Fletcher, surprised.</p>

<p>"It doesn't agree with me to lose my night's
sleep," said Peabody. "I am naturally delicate,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your excuse is not satisfactory, Mr. Peabody.
We are banded together in a little community,
having mutual rights and mutual obligations.
In the arrangements made for the
common safety it is your duty to bear your
part."</p>

<p>"I am willing to provide a substitute," said
Peabody eagerly.</p>

<p>"Where will you find a substitute?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been talking with Tom Nelson. He
says he is willing to serve in my turn."</p>

<p>"He will serve when his own turn comes;
that will be all we can expect of him."</p>

<p>"But he is only a boy. Why should he be
expected to take his turn?"</p>

<p>"If he is old enough to be a substitute, he
is old enough to stand watch for himself."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Fletcher, I am very delicate,"
protested Lawrence Peabody. "I must have
my regular sleep, or I shall be sick."</p>

<p>"We must take our chances of that, Mr.
Peabody."</p>

<p>"I shall be very likely to go to sleep on my
post."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't advise you to," said Fletcher
seriously. "It might be dangerous."</p>

<p>"Dangerous!" ejaculated Peabody nervously.</p>

<p>"Precisely. If a lurking Indian should surprise
you, you might wake up to find yourself
scalped."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed the Bostonian,
his teeth chattering, for he was not of the stuff
of which heroes are made. "Do you&mdash;think
there is any danger of that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Considerable, if you neglect your duty."</p>

<p>"But perhaps I can't help falling asleep."</p>

<p>"Mr. Peabody," said Fletcher sternly, "you
must keep awake. Not only your own safety,
but that of the whole camp, may depend upon
your vigilance. If you choose to risk your
own life, I don't complain of that, but you
shall not imperil ours. I therefore give you
notice, that if you fall asleep on guard you
will be drummed out of camp, and left to shift
for yourself."</p>

<p>"But I couldn't find my way on the prairie,"
said Peabody, very much alarmed.</p>

<p>"You had better think of that when you are
tempted to close your eyes, Mr. Peabody," replied
Fletcher.</p>

<p>Lawrence Peabody walked off, feeling very
much disconcerted. Fervently he wished himself
back in Boston, where there are no Indians,
and a man might sleep from one week's
end to another without any danger of losing
his scalp.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mr. Peabody?" asked
Tom, observing his melancholy appearance.</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall ever live to see California,"
answered Mr. Peabody plaintively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter now?" asked Tom,
checking an inclination to laugh; "are you
sick?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel very well, Tom. I'm very
delicate, and this journey is almost too much
for my strength."</p>

<p>"Oh, cheer up, Mr. Peabody! Think of the
gold that awaits you at the end of the journey."</p>

<p>"It's all that keeps me up, I do assure you.
But I am afraid I shall never live to get
there," said Peabody, with a groan.</p>

<p>"Don't think of such things, Mr. Peabody.
Of course none of us is sure of living, but the
chances are, that we shall reach California in
health, make our fortunes, and go home rich.
At any rate, that's what I am looking forward
to."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind so much but for one
thing, Tom."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Fletcher insists that I shall take my turn
in standing guard. If I were not so delicate
I wouldn't mind; but I know I can't stand it.
I'll give you two dollars to take my place,
every time my turn comes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am willing, if Mr. Fletcher is," said Tom,
who was by no means averse to making a little
extra money.</p>

<p>"But he isn't. I proposed it to him, for I
was sure I could arrange with you; but he refused."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Tom slyly, "he thought
I couldn't fill your place. You are a brave,
resolute man, and I am only a boy."</p>

<p>"Tom&mdash;I&mdash;I don't mind telling you; but I
am afraid I am not brave."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Mr. Peabody! that is only
your modesty."</p>

<p>"But I assure you," said the young Bostonian
earnestly, "I am speaking the truth. If I
should see an Indian crawling near the camp
I'm really afraid I should faint."</p>

<p>"You won't know how brave you are till
you are put to the test."</p>

<p>"But do you think there is any chance of
my being put to the test? Do you think there
are any Indians near?" asked Lawrence Peabody,
wiping the damp perspiration from his
brow.</p>

<p>"Of course there must be," said Tom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
"We are passing through their hunting-grounds,
you know."</p>

<p>"Why did I ever leave Boston?" said Mr.
Peabody sadly.</p>

<p>"You came, as I did, to make your fortune,
Mr. Peabody."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't keep awake, Tom; Mr.
Fletcher tells me, if I don't, that he will turn
me adrift on the prairie. Isn't that hard?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid it is a necessary regulation.
But you won't fall asleep. Your turn will
only come about once in two weeks, and that
isn't much."</p>

<p>"The nights will seem very long."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. I think it'll be fun, for
my part."</p>

<p>"But suppose&mdash;when you are watching&mdash;you
should all at once see an Indian, Tom?"
said Peabody, with a shiver.</p>

<p>"I think it would be rather unlucky for the
Indian," said Tom coolly.</p>

<p>"You are a strange boy, Tom," said Mr.
Peabody.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"You don't seem to care anything about the
danger of being scalped."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe I should like being scalped
any more than you do."</p>

<p>"You might have got off from standing
watch; but you asked to be allowed to."</p>

<p>"That is quite true, Mr. Peabody. I want
to meet my fair share of danger and fatigue."</p>

<p>"You can stand it, for you are strong and
tough. You have not my delicacy of constitution."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's it," said Tom, laughing.</p>

<p>"Would you mind speaking to Fletcher,
and telling him you are willing to take my
place?"</p>

<p>"I will do it, if you wish me to, Mr. Peabody."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Tom; you are a true friend;"
and Mr. Peabody wrung the hand of his young
companion.</p>

<p>Tom was as good as his word. He spoke to
Fletcher on the subject; but the leader of the
expedition was obdurate.</p>

<p>"Can't consent, my boy," he said. "It is
enough for you to take your turn. That young
dandy from Boston needs some discipline to
make a man of him. He will never do anything
in a country like California unless he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
has more grit than he shows at present. I
shall do him a favor by not excusing him."</p>

<p>Tom reported the answer to Peabody, who
groaned in spirit, and nervously waited for
the night when he was to stand watch.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>A SAD SIGHT.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A day</span> later, while the wagon-train was
slowly winding through a mountain defile,
they encountered a sight which made even the
stout-hearted leader look grave. Stretched
out stiff and stark were two figures, cold in
death. They were men of middle age, apparently.
From each the scalp had been removed,
thus betraying that the murderers were Indians.</p>

<p>"I should like to come across the red devils
who did this," said Fletcher.</p>

<p>"What would you do with them?" asked
Ferguson.</p>

<p>"Shoot them down like dogs, or if I could
take them captive they should dangle upon the
boughs of yonder tree."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope I shall be ready to die when my
time comes," said Ferguson; "but I want it
to be in a Christian bed, and not at the hands
of a dirty savage."</p>

<p>Just then Lawrence Peabody came up. He
had been lagging in the rear, as usual.</p>

<p>"What have you found?" he inquired, not
seeing the bodies at first, on account of the
party surrounding them.</p>

<p>"Come here, and see for yourself, Peabody,"
said one of the company.</p>

<p>Lawrence Peabody peered at the dead men&mdash;he
was rather near-sighted&mdash;and turned
very pale.</p>

<p>"Is it the Indians?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's those devils. You can tell their
work when you see it. Don't you see that they
are scalped?"</p>

<p>"I believe I shall faint," said Peabody, his
face becoming of a greenish hue. "Tom, let
me lean on your shoulder. Do&mdash;do you think
it has been done lately?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday, probably," said Ferguson.
"The bodies look fresh."</p>

<p>"Then the Indians that did it must be near
here?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>"These men were either traveling by themselves,
or had strayed away from their party,"
said Fletcher. "It shows how necessary it is
for us to keep together. In union there is
strength."</p>

<p>The bodies were examined. In the pocket
of one was found a letter addressed to James
Collins, dated at some town in Maine. The
writer appeared to be his wife. She spoke of
longing for the time when he should return
with money enough to redeem their farm from
a heavy mortgage.</p>

<p>"Poor woman!" said Ferguson. "She will
wait for her husband in vain. The mortgage
will never be paid through his exertions."</p>

<p>Tom looked sober, as he glanced compassionately
at the poor emigrant.</p>

<p>"He came on the same errand that I did,"
he said. "I hope my journey will have a happier
ending."</p>

<p>"Always hope for the best, Tom," said his
Scotch friend. "You will live happier while
you do live, and, if the worst comes, it will be
time enough to submit to it when you must."</p>

<p>"That is good philosophy, Mr. Ferguson."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed it is, my lad. Don't borrow
trouble."</p>

<p>"We must bury these poor men," said
Fletcher. "We can't leave them out here,
possibly to be devoured by wild beasts. Who
will volunteer for the service?"</p>

<p>"Come, Peabody," said John Miles, a broad-shouldered
giant, who had a good-natured contempt
for the young man from Boston. "Suppose
you and I volunteer."</p>

<p>Lawrence Peabody shrank back in dismay
at the unwelcome proposition.</p>

<p>"I couldn't do it," he said, shivering. "I
never touched a dead body in my life. I am
so delicate that I couldn't do it, I assure you."</p>

<p>"It's lucky we are not all delicate," said
Miles, "or the poor fellows would be left unburied.
I suppose if anything happens to you,
Peabody, you will expect us to bury you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't mention such a thing, Mr.
Miles," entreated Peabody, showing symptoms
of becoming hysterical. "I really can't bear
it."</p>

<p>"It's my belief that nature has made a mistake,
and Peabody was meant for a woman,"
said Miles, shrugging his shoulders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will assist you, my friend," said the
Scotchman. "It's all that remains for us to
do for the poor fellows."</p>

<p>"Not quite all," said Tom. "Somebody
ought to write to the poor wife. We have
her address in the letter you took from the
pocket."</p>

<p>"Well thought of, my lad," said Fletcher.
"Will you undertake it?"</p>

<p>"If you think I can do it properly," said
Tom modestly.</p>

<p>"It'll be grievous news, whoever writes it.
You can do it as well as another."</p>

<p>In due time Mrs. Collins received a letter
revealing the sad fate of her husband, accompanied
with a few simple words of sympathy.</p>

<p>Over the grave a rude cross was planted,
fashioned of two boards, with the name of
James Collins, cut out with a jack-knife, upon
them. This inscription was the work of Miles.</p>

<p>"Somebody may see it who knows Collins,"
he said.</p>

<p>It happened that, on the second night after
the discovery of Collins and his unfortunate
companion, Lawrence Peabody's turn came to
stand watch. He was very uneasy and nervous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
through the day. In the hope of escaping
the ordeal he so much dreaded he bound a
handkerchief round his head.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mr. Peabody?" asked
Fletcher.</p>

<p>"I've got a fearful headache," groaned Peabody.
"It seems to me as if it would split
open."</p>

<p>"Let me feel of it," said Fletcher.</p>

<p>"It doesn't feel hot; it doesn't throb," he
said.</p>

<p>"It aches terribly," said Peabody. "I'm
very subject to headache. It is the effect of a
delicate constitution."</p>

<p>"The fellow is shamming," said Fletcher
to himself; and he felt disgust rather than
sympathy.</p>

<p>"It's a little curious, Mr. Peabody, that this
headache should not come upon you till the
day you are to stand on watch," remarked
the leader, with a sarcasm which even the
young man from Boston detected.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's strange," he admitted, "and very
unlucky, for of course you won't expect a sick
man to watch."</p>

<p>"You don't look at it in the right light, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Peabody. I regard it as rather lucky than
otherwise."</p>

<p>Lawrence Peabody stared.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, Mr. Fletcher," he
said.</p>

<p>"If you have the headache, it will prevent
you from going to sleep, and you remember
you expressed yourself as afraid that you
might. If you were quite well, I might feel
rather afraid of leaving the camp in your
charge. Now, I am sure you won't fall
asleep."</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody listened in dismay. The very
plan to which he had resorted in the hope of
evading duty was likely to fasten that duty
upon him.</p>

<p>"He'll be well before night," thought
Fletcher shrewdly; and he privately imparted
the joke to the rest of the party. The result
was that Mr. Peabody became an object of
general attention.</p>

<p>In half an hour the young man from Boston
removed his handkerchief from his head.</p>

<p>"Are you feeling better, Mr. Peabody?"
asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Very much better," said Peabody.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your headache seems to pass off suddenly."</p>

<p>"Yes, it always does," said the young
Bostonian. "I am like mother in that. She
had a delicate constitution, just like mine.
One minute she would have a headache as if
her head would split open, and half an hour
afterward she would feel as well as usual."</p>

<p>"You are very fortunate. I was afraid
your headache would make it uncomfortable
for you to watch to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, it would; but, as the captain said, it
would have kept me awake. Now I don't believe
I can keep from sleeping on my post."</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell Fletcher so?"</p>

<p>"Won't you tell him, Tom? He might pay
more attention to it if you told him."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Peabody. You are certainly the
most suitable person to speak to him. What
makes you think he would pay more attention
to me, who am only a boy?"</p>

<p>"He seems to like you, Tom."</p>

<p>"I hope he does, but really, Mr. Peabody,
you must attend to your own business."</p>

<p>Fletcher was at the head of the train, walking
beside the first wagon. Hearing hurried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
steps, he turned, and saw Mr. Lawrence Peabody,
panting for breath.</p>

<p>"Have you got over your headache, Mr. Peabody?"
he asked, with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Fletcher, it's all gone."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it."</p>

<p>"It would have kept me awake to-night, as
you remarked," said Peabody. "Now, I am
really afraid that I shall fall asleep."</p>

<p>"That would be bad for you."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"You remember those two poor fellows
whom we found scalped the other day?"</p>

<p>"I shall never forget them," said Lawrence
Peabody, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Better think of them to-night. If you go
to sleep on watch, those very Indians may
serve you in the same way."</p>

<p>"Oh, good gracious!" ejaculated Peabody,
turning pale.</p>

<p>"They or some of their tribe are, no doubt,
near at hand."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you could excuse me,
Mr. Fletcher?" stammered Peabody, panic-stricken.</p>

<p>"No!" thundered Fletcher, so sternly that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the unhappy Bostonian shrank back in dismay.</p>

<p>For the credit of Boston, it may be said
that John Miles&mdash;a broad-shouldered young
giant, who did not know what fear was&mdash;more
honorably represented the same city.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>A NIGHT PANIC.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Lawrence Peabody's</span> feelings when night
approached were not unlike those of a prisoner
under sentence of death. He was timid, nervous,
and gifted with a lively imagination.
His fears were heightened by the sad spectacle
that he had recently witnessed. His depression
was apparent to all; but I regret to say that
it inspired more amusement than sympathy.
Men winked at each other as they saw him
pass; and, with the exception of Tom and his
Scotch friend, probably nobody pitied the
poor fellow.</p>

<p>"He's a poor creature, Tom," said Donald
Ferguson; "but I pity him. We wouldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
mind watching to-night; but I doubt it's a
terrible thing to him."</p>

<p>"I would volunteer in his place, but Mr.
Fletcher won't agree to it," said Tom.</p>

<p>"He is right. The young man must take
his turn. He won't dread it so much a second
time."</p>

<p>"What would the poor fellow do if he
should see an Indian?"</p>

<p>"Faint, likely; but that is not probable."</p>

<p>"Mr. Fletcher thinks there are some not
far off."</p>

<p>"They don't attack in the night, so I hear."</p>

<p>"That seems strange to me. I should think
the night would be most favorable for them."</p>

<p>"It's their way. Perhaps they have some
superstition that hinders."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it, at any rate. I can sleep
with greater comfort."</p>

<p>The rest were not as considerate as Tom
and Ferguson. They tried, indeed, to excite
still further the fears of the young Bostonian.</p>

<p>"Peabody," said Miles, "have you made
your will?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Peabody nervously. "Why
should I?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I was thinking that if anything happened
to you to-night you might like to say
how your things are to be disposed of. You've
got a gold watch, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peabody nervously.</p>

<p>"And a little money, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not very much, Mr. Miles."</p>

<p>"No matter about that. Of course if you
are killed you won't have occasion for it,"
said Miles, in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't talk that way,"
said Peabody irritably. "It makes me nervous."</p>

<p>"What's the use of being nervous? It won't
do any good."</p>

<p>"Do you really think, Mr. Miles, there is
much danger?" faltered Peabody.</p>

<p>"Of course there is danger. But the post
of danger is the post of honor. Now, Peabody,
I want to give you a piece of advice. If you
spy one of those red devils crouching in the
grass, don't stop to parley, but up with your
revolver, and let him have it in the head. If
you can't hit him in the head, hit him where
you can."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be better," suggested Peabody,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
in a tremulous voice, "to wake you up, or Mr.
Fletcher?"</p>

<p>"While you were doing it the savage would
make mince-meat of you. No, Peabody, fire
at once. This would wake us all up, and if
you didn't kill the reptile we would do it for
you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he would see me first," suggested
Peabody, in a troubled tone.</p>

<p>"You mustn't let him. You must have your
eyes all about you. You are not near-sighted,
are you?"</p>

<p>"I believe I am&mdash;a little," said Peabody
eagerly, thinking that this might be esteemed
a disqualification for the position he dreaded.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I guess it won't make any difference,
only you will need to be more vigilant."</p>

<p>"I wish I was blind; just for to-night,"
thought Peabody to himself, with an inward
sigh. "Then they would have to excuse me."</p>

<p>John Miles overtook Fletcher, who was with
the head wagon.</p>

<p>"Captain Fletcher," he said, "I am afraid
Peabody will make a mighty poor watch."</p>

<p>"Just my opinion."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is more timid than the average woman.
I've got a sister at home that has ten times his
courage. If she hadn't I wouldn't own the relationship."</p>

<p>"I am not willing to excuse him."</p>

<p>"Of course not; but I'll tell you what I'll
do. I'll keep an eye open myself, so that we
sha'n't wholly depend on him."</p>

<p>"If you are willing to do it, Miles, we shall
all be indebted to you. Don't let him know it,
though."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to. He shall suppose he is
the only man awake in camp."</p>

<p>At a comparatively early hour the party
stretched themselves out upon the ground, inviting
sleep. Generally they did not have to
wait long. The day's march brought with it
considerable physical fatigue. Even those who
were light sleepers at home slept well on the
trip across the plains. Few or none remained
awake half an hour after lying down. So
Peabody knew that he would soon be practically
alone.</p>

<p>With a heavy heart he began to pace slowly
forward and back. He came to where Tom
lay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tom&mdash;Tom Nelson," he called, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Tom, in a
sleepy tone.</p>

<p>"Are you asleep?"</p>

<p>"No; but I soon shall be."</p>

<p>"Won't you try to keep awake a little
while? It won't seem so lonesome."</p>

<p>"Sorry I can't accommodate you, Mr. Peabody;
but I'm awfully tired and sleepy."</p>

<p>"Who's that talking there?" drowsily demanded
the nearest emigrant. "Can't you
keep quiet, and let a fellow sleep?"</p>

<p>"Good night, Mr. Peabody," said Tom, by
way of putting an end to the conversation.</p>

<p>"Good night," returned the sentinel disconsolately.</p>

<p>The hours passed on, and Lawrence Peabody
maintained his watch. He was in no
danger of going to sleep, feeling too timid and
nervous. He began to feel a little more comfortable.
He could see nothing suspicious,
and hear nothing except the deep breathing
of his sleeping comrades.</p>

<p>"It is not so bad as I expected," he muttered
to himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>He began to feel a little self-complacent,
and to reflect that he had underrated his own
courage. He privately reflected that he was
doing as well as any of his predecessors in
duty. He began to think that after he had
got back to Boston with a fortune, gained in
California, he could impress his friends with
a narrative of his night-watch on the distant
prairies. But his courage had not yet been
tested.</p>

<p>He took out his watch to see how time was
passing.</p>

<p>It pointed to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'twelev'">twelve</ins> o'clock.</p>

<p>Why there should be anything more alarming
in twelve o'clock than in any other hour
I can't pretend to say, but the fact none will
question. Mr. Peabody felt a nervous thrill
when his eyes rested on the dial. He looked
about him, and the darkness seemed blacker
and more awe-inspiring than ever, now that
he knew it to be midnight.</p>

<p>"Will it ever be morning?" he groaned.
"Four long hours at least before there will
be light. I don't know how I am going to
stand it."</p>

<p>Now, there was attached to the wagon-train
one of those universally despised but useful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
animals, a donkey, the private property of a
man from Iowa, who expected to make it of
service in California. The animal was tethered
near the camp, and was generally quiet.
But to-night he was wakeful, and managed
about midnight to slip his tether, and wandered
off. Peabody did not observe his escape.
His vigilance was somewhat relaxed,
and with his head down he gave way to
mournful reflection. Suddenly the donkey,
who was now but a few rods distant, uplifted
his voice in a roar which the night stillness
made louder than usual. It was too much
for the overwrought nerves of the sentinel.
He gave a shriek of terror, fired wildly in the
air, and sank fainting to the ground. Of
course the camp was roused. Men jumped to
their feet, and, rubbing their eyes, gazed
around them in bewilderment.</p>

<p>It was not long before the truth dawned
upon them. There lay the sentinel, insensible
from fright, his discharged weapon at his
feet, and the almost equally terrified donkey
was in active flight, making the air vocal with
his peculiar cries.</p>

<p>There was a great shout of laughter, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
midst of which Peabody recovered consciousness.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he asked, looking about
him wildly, and he instinctively felt for his
scalp, which he was relieved to find still in its
place.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the leader.
"What made you fire?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought it was the Indians," faltered
Peabody. "I thought I heard their horrid
war-whoop."</p>

<p>"Not very complimentary to the Indians to
compare them with donkeys," said Miles.</p>

<p>Lawrence Peabody was excused from duty
for the remainder of the night, his place being
taken by Miles and Tom in turn.</p>

<p>It was a long time before he heard the last
of his ridiculous panic, but he was not sensitive
as to his reputation for courage, and he
bore it, on the whole, pretty well.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>MR. PEABODY IS WORSTED.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> traveler of to-day who is whirled across
the continent in six days and a half has little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
conception of what the overland journey was
in the year 1850. Week after week and month
after month slipped away between the start
and the arrival on the western slope of the
Sierra Nevadas. Delicate women and children
of tender years developed extraordinary
endurance, and showed remarkable fortitude
on the wearisome trip. But the hope of bettering
their fortunes was the magnet that
drew them steadily on, day after day, in their
march across the plains.</p>

<p>Tom was at an age when adventure has a
charm. His feet were often weary; but he
never tired of the journey. Every morning
found him active, alert, and ready for the toilsome
walk. He was, indeed, impatient for the
time to come when he could be earning something
to pay up his debt to Squire Hudson,
and so relieve his father from the additional
burden assumed for his sake. Otherwise he
was quite content to plod on, seeing something
new every day.</p>

<p>"You're always cheerful, Tom, my lad,"
said Ferguson, one day.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom. "I am having a good
time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Youth is aye the time for enjoyment.
When I was a lad like you I might have been
the same."</p>

<p>"Don't you enjoy the journey, Mr. Ferguson?"
asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I'm getting tired of it, Tom. I look upon
it as a means to an end. I'm in a hurry to
reach the mines."</p>

<p>"So am I, Mr. Ferguson, for that matter."</p>

<p>"And I can't help thinking, what if they
don't turn out as well as we expect? Then
there'll be months lost, besides a good bit of
money," replied Ferguson.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure there is plenty of gold, and
we shall get our share," said Tom confidently;
"that is, if we have our health."</p>

<p>"I hope it'll be as you say, my lad. Indeed,
I think you are right. You have taught
me a lesson."</p>

<p>"Have I, Mr. Ferguson? What is it?"</p>

<p>"Always to look on the bright side. It is
a lesson worth learning. It makes a man feel
happier, and often gives courage to press on
to the accomplishment of his purpose."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is natural to me," said Tom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a happy gift. It is a pity that poor
creature from Boston hadn't it."</p>

<p>Lawrence Peabody was approaching, and
this no doubt led to the allusion. He was
limping along, looking decidedly down in
the mouth, which, indeed, was not unusual.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, Mr. Peabody?"
asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I'm almost gone," groaned Peabody.
"My strength is exhausted, and, besides, I've
got a terrible corn on my left foot."</p>

<p>"How long has that been?"</p>

<p>"For two or three days. It's torture for
me to walk. I don't know but you'll have to
leave me here on the prairie to perish."</p>

<p>"Not so bad as that, Mr. Peabody, I hope.
Perhaps Mr. Chapman will lend you his donkey
to ride upon."</p>

<p>The owner of the donkey was within hearing
distance, and at once expressed a willingness
to lend his animal to Mr. Peabody.</p>

<p>"That will be better than perishing on the
prairies," said Tom cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I am not much used to riding," said Peabody
cautiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"He won't run away with you, Peabody,"
said the owner. "He's too lazy."</p>

<p>Lawrence Peabody was already aware of
this fact, and it gave him courage to accept
the offered help. He mounted Solomon&mdash;as
the donkey was called, for some unknown
reason&mdash;and for a time enjoyed the relief
from the toil of walking. He became quite
cheerful, and was disposed to congratulate
himself upon his success, when an unfortunate
fit of obstinacy came over Solomon. It
dawned upon the sagacious animal that it
would be much easier to travel without a
load, and, turning his head, he looked thoughtfully
at his rider.</p>

<p>"Get up, Solomon!" exclaimed Peabody,
striking the animal on the haunch.</p>

<p>Solomon felt that this was taking a personal
liberty and he stood stock-still, his face
expressive of obstinacy.</p>

<p>"Why don't he go on?" asked Peabody,
perplexed.</p>

<p>"He's stopping to rest," said Tom. "I am
afraid he is lazy."</p>

<p>"Go along!" exclaimed Peabody, again
using his whip. But the animal did not budge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is really very provoking," murmured
the rider. "What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Don't give up to him," advised one of the
company. "Here, let me whip him."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I wish you would."</p>

<p>It was an unlucky speech. The other complied
with the request, and delivered his blow
with such emphasis that Solomon's equanimity
was seriously disturbed. He dashed forward
with what speed he could command,
Mr. Peabody holding on, in a sort of panic,
till he was a hundred yards away. Then he
stopped suddenly, lowering his head, and his
hapless rider was thrown over it, landing
some distance in advance. Solomon looked at
him with grim humor, if a donkey is capable
of such a feeling, and, apparently satisfied,
turned and walked complacently back to the
wagon-train.</p>

<p>Several of the company, witnessing the accident,
hurried forward to Mr. Peabody's assistance.
They picked him up, groaning and
bewildered, but not much hurt.</p>

<p>"None of your limbs broken," said Miles.
"I guess you'll do."</p>

<p>"I'm badly shaken up," moaned Peabody.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will do you good," said Miles bluntly.</p>

<p>"You had better try it yourself, then," retorted
Peabody, with unwonted spirit.</p>

<p>"Good for you!" laughed Miles. "I suspect
you are not dead yet."</p>

<p>"What made you put me on such a vicious
beast?" asked Peabody of the owner.</p>

<p>"Solomon isn't vicious; he's only lazy,"
said Chapman. "We can't blame him much."</p>

<p>"I think he ought to be shot," said Peabody,
painfully rising, and stretching out one
limb after another to make sure that none
was broken.</p>

<p>"You seem to be unlucky, Mr. Peabody,"
said Tom.</p>

<p>"I'm always unlucky," moaned Peabody.</p>

<p>"Will you ride again, Mr. Peabody?" asked
Chapman. "I'll catch Solomon for you, if
you like."</p>

<p>"Not for fifty dollars!" exclaimed Peabody
energetically. "It is as much as anybody's
life is worth."</p>

<p>"If you will make me the same offer, I
won't refuse, Mr. Chapman," said Tom.</p>

<p>"You can mount him, if you like."</p>

<p>Tom waited for no second invitation. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
approached Solomon cautiously, vaulted upon
his back, and the animal, disagreeably surprised,
had recourse to the same tactics which
had proved so successful in the case of the
young man from Boston. But he had a different
kind of a rider to deal with. Tom had
been accustomed to ride from the time he was
six years of age, and he stuck to his seat in
spite of all attempts to dislodge him. So far
from feeling alarmed, he enjoyed the struggle.</p>

<p>"It's no go, Solomon!" he said gaily.
"You've tackled the wrong customer this time.
Better make up your mind to go as I want you
to."</p>

<p>Solomon came to the same conclusion after
a time. He had tried his ordinary tactics, and
they had proved unavailing. The struggle had
been witnessed with some interest by the other
members of the company.</p>

<p>"You can ride, youngster; that's a fact,"
said the owner of the donkey. "I didn't say
anything, but I rather expected to see you follow
Peabody."</p>

<p>"I'm used to riding," said Tom modestly.
"Mr. Peabody is not."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Every lad ought to know how to ride,"
said Ferguson. "It's a deal manlier than
smoking a cigar, to my thinking."</p>

<p>"I can smoke a cigar," said Peabody, desirous
probably of appearing to possess one
manly accomplishment.</p>

<p>"You will hardly find it as useful as riding
in the new country you are going to, Mr. Peabody,"
said Ferguson dryly.</p>

<p>"I'd give something for a good cigar myself,"
said John Miles.</p>

<p>"I prefer riding," said Tom. "I never
smoked a cigar in my life."</p>

<p>"You are just as well off without it, my
lad," said the Scotchman. "It don't do men any
good, and always harms boys."</p>

<p>Peabody never again mounted Solomon.
One trial was sufficient, and, footsore and lame
as he was, he decidedly preferred to walk.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>THE LOST HORSE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Day</span> followed day, and every sunset found
the party from eighteen to twenty miles nearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the land of gold. They had not yet been molested
by Indians, though on more than one
occasion they had encountered the remains of
those whom the savages had ruthlessly slaughtered.
When they witnessed such a spectacle
they were moved less by fear than indignation.</p>

<p>"I didn't think I should ever thirst for a
fellow creature's blood," said John Miles;
"but if I could meet the savages that did this
bloody work, I would shoot them down like
dogs, and sleep all the more soundly for it.
How is it with you, friend Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"I am inclined to agree with you," said the
Scotchman. "When an Indian makes himself
a beast of prey he should be treated accordingly."</p>

<p>"Are there any Indians in California?"
asked Peabody nervously.</p>

<p>"I don't think we shall have any trouble
with them there, Mr. Peabody," said Ferguson.</p>

<p>"Then I wish I was there now. It must be
terrible to be scalped;" and the young man
from Boston shuddered.</p>

<p>"I don't think it would be an agreeable surgical
operation," said Fletcher, who had just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
come up. "Let us hope that we shall not be
called upon to undergo it."</p>

<p>The next morning, when breakfast was
over, and the party was preparing to start, an
unpleasant discovery was made. One of the
most valuable horses was missing. He must
have slipped his tether during the night, and
strayed away; as they were situated, the loss
of such an animal would be felt.</p>

<p>"He can't be far away," said Fletcher.
"Some of us must go after him."</p>

<p>"Let Peabody mount the mustang, and
undertake to find him," suggested John Miles,
winking at the captain.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peabody," said Captain Fletcher
gravely, "will you undertake to recover the
horse? We shall all feel under great obligations
to you."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hope you will excuse me, Captain
Fletcher," stammered Peabody, in great alarm.
"I know I couldn't find the horse. I shouldn't
know where to look."</p>

<p>"This is where he got away. You can see
his trail in the grass," said Scott, a young man
from Indiana. "All you will have to do will
be to follow the trail, Mr. Peabody."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm very near-sighted," pleaded Peabody.
"I should lose my way, and never come back."</p>

<p>"Carrying the mustang with you? That
would be a loss indeed," said John Miles pointedly.
"On the whole, Captain Fletcher, we
had better excuse Mr. Peabody."</p>

<p>"Mr. Peabody is excused," said the leader.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Peabody, looking relieved.
"I would go, I am sure, if I could do
any good; but I know I couldn't."</p>

<p>"Who will volunteer?" asked Fletcher.</p>

<p>"Let me go," said Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>"You are not afraid of losing your way,
Tom?" said Miles.</p>

<p>"No; or if I do, I will find it again."</p>

<p>"That boy is more of a man now than Peabody
will ever be," said Miles, in a low voice
to Ferguson.</p>

<p>"That he is," said the Scotchman, who was
a firm friend of our young hero. "There is
the making of a noble man in him."</p>

<p>"I believe you."</p>

<p>"I have no objection to your going, Tom,"
said Fletcher; "but it is better that you should
have company. Who will go with the boy?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"I," said several, among them John Miles
and Henry Scott.</p>

<p>"You may go, Scott," said the leader. "I
have work for Miles at camp. The sooner you
get started the better."</p>

<p>"All right, captain. Come along, Tom."</p>

<p>The two were in the saddle before two minutes
had passed, and, guided by the trail,
struck out upon the prairie.</p>

<p>Scott was a tall, broad-shouldered young
farmer, not over twenty-five, strong and athletic,
and reported, the best runner, wrestler,
and vaulter in the party. Tom was very well
pleased to have his company.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3>INDIAN CASUISTRY.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I should</span> like to know when the horse got
away," said Scott, as he and Tom rode on side
by side; "then we could calculate how far we
should have to go before overtaking him."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't be likely to travel all the time,
would he?" asked Tom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Probably not. He may have gone only a
mile or two. Are your eyes good?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good."</p>

<p>"Look about, then, and see if you can anywhere
see anything of the rover."</p>

<p>Scott and Tom, drawing rein, looked searchingly
in all directions; but nowhere was the
lost animal visible.</p>

<p>"Somebody may have found him," suggested
Tom.</p>

<p>"That may be. If so, we have a harder
job before us."</p>

<p>The prairie was not quite level, but was
what is called a rolling prairie, and this limited
the view. Otherwise it would have been
easy for a person, whose sight was keen, to
have distinguished an object as large as a
horse at a distance of many miles.</p>

<p>"Are you sure we are on the right track,
Mr. Scott?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can see by the trail."</p>

<p>"I can see no hoof-marks."</p>

<p>"Not just here; but look closely, and you
will see slight marks of disturbance in the
grass. As long as these signs last we need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
have no doubts as to our being on the right
track."</p>

<p>"The same trail will lead us back to our
party," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, I shouldn't like to part from them
in this country. It would be rather a bad
place to be lost without provisions."</p>

<p>They had ridden about five miles, when the
trail became clearer and better defined. In
fact, the marks in the prairie grass appeared
more numerous than a single horse would be
likely to make.</p>

<p>Scott looked grave.</p>

<p>"We will halt here a moment, Tom," he
said. "I want to examine the trail."</p>

<p>"Shall I get off my horse?"</p>

<p>"No; it is not necessary."</p>

<p>Scott dismounted and walked about, closely
examining the marks in the grass.</p>

<p>Finally he looked up.</p>

<p>"I begin to think it doubtful whether we
shall recover Dan," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He has been found and carried off," was
the reply. "Do you see the double trail?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom, after a brief examination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"It means that a horseman has found Dan,
and led him away. This rather complicates
matters."</p>

<p>"What do you think we had better do?"
inquired Tom.</p>

<p>"That requires consideration. I could tell
better if I knew by whom the horse had been
found. The finder may be honest, and would,
in that case, surrender it on our appearing,
and claiming him. But, again, he may be dishonest,
and resist our claims."</p>

<p>"We are two to one," said Tom stoutly.</p>

<p>"We don't know that. The man may belong
to a party."</p>

<p>"The members of his party would know
that the horse was not his."</p>

<p>"Quite true, if the party was composed of
decent persons, like our own; but that is not
certain."</p>

<p>"Then will you go back without Dan?"
asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I don't want to do that. In fact I should
be ashamed to. Captain Fletcher would conclude
that he might as well have sent Peabody;
and I am not anxious to be classed with
him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor I," said Tom, smiling.</p>

<p>"So the only thing is to push on, and make
what discoveries we may."</p>

<p>"All right," said Tom cheerfully.</p>

<p>They rode on for a couple of miles, having
no difficulty in following the trail, until they
reached the brow of a small eminence. Here
they were greeted with a sight that startled
them. A group of a dozen Indians were reclining
on the grass, with their horses fastened
near them. Startled as they were, they detected
the animal of which they were in search
among the Indian horses.</p>

<p>"We've walked into a trap with our eyes
open, Tom," said Scott, halting his horse mechanically.
His bronzed face was a little pale,
for he knew well the character of the savages
before him, the hopelessness of escape, and the
terrible fate that probably awaited them.</p>

<p>"Shall we turn and fly, Mr. Scott?" asked
Tom hurriedly.</p>

<p>"It would be of no use, Tom. We must
stay and face the music."</p>

<p>Upon the appearance of the two friends the
Indians had sprung to their feet, and the
colloquy was scarcely over before there was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Indian at each bridle-rein. They made signs,
easily understood, for Tom and Scott to dismount.</p>

<p>"Stop a minute," said Scott, with creditable
coolness, considering the great peril in which
he knew himself to be. "Is there any one here
who speaks English?"</p>

<p>An elderly Indian stepped forward quickly,
and said, "Speak, white man. I speak English
a little."</p>

<p>"Good," said Scott; "then I want you to
tell your friends here that I came after a horse
that left our camp last night. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>The Indian inclined his head.</p>

<p>"There he is," continued Scott, pointing
with his finger to Dan. "Give him to me, and
I will go away."</p>

<p>The interpreter turned to his companions,
and repeated what Scott had said. Evidently
it was not favorably received, as Scott could
see by the menacing looks that were turned
upon him. He waited, with some anxiety, for
the answer to his claim. He had to wait for
some minutes, during which the Indians appeared
to be consulting. It came at last.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"The white man has lied," said the Indian
sententiously. "The horse is ours."</p>

<p>"That's pretty cool, eh, Tom?" said Scott,
provoked; not only by the denial of his claim,
but by the charge of falsehood.</p>

<p>Tom did not answer, thinking silence more
prudent.</p>

<p>The Indian interpreter looked suspiciously
from one to the other. He understood what
"cool" meant, but was not familiar with the
special sense in which Scott used it.</p>

<p>"I will prove that the horse is ours," said
Scott. "Here, Dan!"</p>

<p>The horse whinnied, and tried to reach
Scott, upon hearing his name pronounced.</p>

<p>"There," said Scott triumphantly, "you see
the horse knows me. I have not lied."</p>

<p>The speech was an imprudent one. Indians
are not lawyers, but they understand the familiar
saying, that "possession is nine points
of the law." That the horse was a valuable
one they understood; and they had no intention
of parting with him. Still more, they
looked with covetous eyes at the horses ridden
by Scott and the boy, and they had already
made up their minds to seize them also.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"The white man is a magician," said the interpreter.
"He has bewitched the horse. The
horse is ours. He has always belonged to us."</p>

<p>"It's no use, Tom," said Scott. "They are
bound to keep Dan, and I don't see how we
can help it. We had better give him up, and
get away if we can. All the same, the fellow
is an outrageous liar."</p>

<p>He spoke in a low voice, and the interpreter,
though listening attentively, did not quite
catch what was said.</p>

<p>"I guess you are right," said Tom.</p>

<p>Scott turned to the interpreter.</p>

<p>"Well, if you think it is yours, squire, I
reckon you will keep it. So we'll say good
morning, and go."</p>

<p>He pulled the rein, but the Indian at his
bridle did not let go.</p>

<p>"Good morning, gentlemen," said Scott.
"We are going."</p>

<p>"White man must stay," said the Indian
interpreter decisively.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Scott impatiently.</p>

<p>"He has tried to steal Indian's horse," said
the wily savage.</p>

<p>"Well, by gosh; that's turning the tables<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
with a vengeance," ejaculated Scott. "They're
rather ahead of white rogues, Tom. Will you
let the boy go?" he asked.</p>

<p>"White boy stay, too," answered the interpreter,
after a brief reference to the leader of
the Indian party.</p>

<p>"Tom," said Scott rapidly, and not appearing
to be excited, lest his excitement should
lead to suspicion, "none of them are mounted.
Lash your horse, and tear from the grasp of
the man that holds him; then follow me. It
is our only chance."</p>

<p>Tom's heart beat rapidly. He knew that all
his nerve was called for; but he did not falter.</p>

<p>"Give the signal," he said.</p>

<p>"One, two, three!" said Scott rapidly.
Simultaneously both lashed their horses. The
startled animals sprang forward. The grips
of the Indians, who were not suspecting any
attempts at escape, were already relaxed, and
before they were fully aware of what was intended
our two friends were galloping away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>A RACE FOR LIFE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Indians were taken by surprise. They
so outnumbered their intended captives that
they had not anticipated an attempt at escape.
But they had no intention of losing
their prey. There was a howl of surprise and
disappointment; then they sprang for their
horses, and, with little delay, were on the
track of our two friends.</p>

<p>The delay was small, but it was improved by
Scott and Tom. Pressing their animals to
their highest speed they gained a lead of several
hundred feet before their savage pursuers
had fairly started. It was well that Tom was
a good rider, or he might not have been able to
keep his seat. In fact, he had never ridden so
rapidly before: but he felt that he was riding
for his life, and was only anxious to ride
faster. Scott had felt a little anxious on this
point; but his anxiety vanished when he saw
how easily and fearlessly his boy companion
kept at his side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well done, Tom!" he said, as they flew
over the prairie. "Keep up this pace, and we
will escape yet."</p>

<p>"I can do it, if my horse holds out," returned
Tom briefly.</p>

<p>Scott looked over his shoulder, and, brave
man as he was, it almost made him shudder.
The whole party of Indians was on his track.
He could see their dusky faces, distorted by
wrath, and the longing for a savage revenge.
He knew that Tom and he had little to hope
for if they were caught. Fortunately their
horses were strong and fleet, and not likely
to break down.</p>

<p>"Ride for your life, Tom!" he shouted.
"They will show us no mercy if they catch
us."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Scott!" said Tom, his face
flushed, and panting with excitement. If he
had not felt that so much depended upon it; if
he could have thrust out from his mind the
sense of the awful peril in which he stood&mdash;he
would have enjoyed the furious pace at which
his horse was carrying him.</p>

<p>The horses ridden by the Indians were not
equal in speed or endurance to those which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the two friends bestrode. They were fresher
indeed, but they did not make up for the difference
between them. There was one exception,
however: Dan, the stolen horse, was not
only equal to either of their horses, but had
the advantage of being fresher. This, after
a while, began to tell. It was ridden by a
young Indian brave, a brother of the leader.
Soon he drew away from his companions, and,
yard by yard, lessened the distance between
himself and the pursued. At the end of three
miles he was close upon them, and at least
fifty rods in advance of his comrades. Scott
saw this in one of his backward glances.</p>

<p>"Tom," said he, "the redskin on Dan is
overhauling us."</p>

<p>"Will he catch us?"</p>

<p>"I mean to catch him," said Scott coolly.</p>

<p>Tom did not need to ask for an explanation.
Scott wheeled round, took hasty but accurate
aim at the Indian, and fired. The hapless warrior
reeled in his saddle, loosed his hold of the
reins, and fell to the ground, while his horse,
continuing in his course, his pace accelerated
by fright, soon galloped alongside of Scott.
There was a howl of rage from the main body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of Indians, who saw the fate of their comrade,
without being able to help him.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom, ride as you never rode before!"
shouted Scott. "We will circumvent those
Indian devils yet, and bring Dan safe into
camp. Come along, Dan, old fellow; you're
doing nobly."</p>

<p>Dan recognized the familiar voice. He entered
into the spirit of the race, and, relieved
from the weight of his rider, dashed forward
with increased speed, till he led, and Scott and
Tom were forced to follow.</p>

<p>The Indians were mad with rage. Their
comrade had received a fatal wound. They
saw the round hole in his breast, from which
the life-blood was gushing, and they thirsted
for vengeance.</p>

<p>Should two palefaces, one of them a boy,
escape from them? That would be a disgrace,
indeed; the blood of their brother called for
blood in return.</p>

<p>Could they have inspired their horses with
the same spirit which animated themselves,
they might, perhaps, have overtaken their intended
captives; but, happily for our two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
friends, the horses were less interested than
their riders.</p>

<p>The danger was well-nigh over. It was
scarcely two miles to the camp. There they
would be so re-enforced that the Indians would
not venture an attack. That was the goal they
had in view. Already they could see in the
distance the wagon-train, ready for a start.
They were surely safe now. But at this unlucky
moment Tom's horse stumbled. The
motion was so rapid that he could not retain
his seat. He was thrown over the horse's head,
and lay stunned and insensible upon the
ground. His horse kept on his way to the
camp.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3>TOM BECOMES AN INDIAN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Scott</span> did not immediately notice Tom's
mishap. The boy had shown himself so good
a rider that such an accident had not occurred
to him as likely to happen. When he did look
back there was already a considerable distance
between them. In fact, Tom lay midway between
the Indians and himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>What was he to do?</p>

<p>If he returned there was no hope of rescuing
Tom; and he would infallibly fall into the
hands of the Indian pursuers. In that case
his fate was sealed. He had killed an Indian
warrior, and his life would pay the forfeit.
By going on he could head a rescuing party
from the camp. His heart ached for Tom. It
was hard to leave him in the hands of the savage
foe; but Tom was a boy, and there was
hope that he would be spared; so he felt that it
was better to continue his flight.</p>

<p>There was a shout of fierce joy when the Indians
saw Tom's fall. They would have preferred
to capture Scott, for he it was who had
killed their comrade; but they were glad to
have one prisoner. They reined up their
horses, and halted beside the still insensible
boy. They held a brief consultation, and decided
not to continue the pursuit. They could
see the encampment, which Scott was sure to
reach before he could be overtaken. They
could not tell the number of the party to
which he belonged; but, being few in numbers
themselves, the risk would be a hazardous one.
They decided to retire with their prisoner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Tom was lifted to a seat in front of one of the
party, and they rode leisurely back.</p>

<p>This was the position in which our hero
found himself when he roused from his stupor.
One glance revealed to him the whole. His
heart sank within him. They might kill him.
Remembering the ghastly sights he had seen
on his trip across the plains, he thought it
likely that they would. Life was sweet to
Tom. To what boy of sixteen is it not? It
seemed hard to be cut off in the threshold of an
active career, and by savage hands. But there
was an additional pang in the thought that
now he would be unable to help his father.
The result of his plan would only be to impose
an additional burden upon the modest home
which his father found it so hard to keep up.
Tom sighed; and, for the first time in his life,
he felt discouraged.</p>

<p>He looked about him, scanning the dark,
grave faces, and read no hope or encouragement
in any. Finally the Indians came to a
halt at their old camping-ground, and Tom
was lifted from the horse. He was placed upon
the ground, in the center of the group. Then
followed a consultation. From the glances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
directed toward him Tom understood that he
was the subject of deliberation. In fact, his
fate was being decided.</p>

<p>It was certainly a trying ordeal for our
young hero. He was not sure of half an hour's
life. An unfavorable decision might be followed
by immediate execution. Tom felt that
his best course was to remain perfectly passive.
He could not understand what was said; but
we are able to acquaint the reader with the
general purport of the conference.</p>

<p>Several of the Indians favored immediate
death.</p>

<p>"Our brother's blood calls for vengeance,"
they said. "The white boy must die."</p>

<p>"The boy did not kill him," said others.
"It was the white warrior who spilled our
brother's blood. He must be pursued and
slain."</p>

<p>"What, then, shall be done with the boy?
Shall he go?"</p>

<p>"No; we will keep him. He has strong
limbs. We will adopt him into our tribe. He
will make a brave warrior."</p>

<p>"He shall be my brother," said the chief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
"I will take him in place of my brother who is
dead."</p>

<p>There was a low murmur of approval.
Even those who had first recommended the
infliction of death seemed to have changed
their minds. They looked at the boy as he
lay stretched out upon the ground. He was
stout, comely, and strongly made. He had
proved that he was an admirable rider. If
he should join them he would grow up into a
warrior who would do credit to their tribe.</p>

<p>So the matter was settled. The only thing
that remained was to acquaint the prisoner
with the decision.</p>

<p>The interpreter approached Tom, and said,
"White boy, you are our captive. Why should
we not kill you?"</p>

<p>"You can if you wish," answered Tom;
"but why should you kill me? I have done
you no harm."</p>

<p>"Our brother is killed. He lies dead upon
the plain."</p>

<p>"I did not kill him," said Tom.</p>

<p>"The white boy speaks truth. He did not
kill our brother, but his white friend took his
life."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"You ought not to kill me for that," said
Tom, gathering courage, for he inferred he
was to live.</p>

<p>"The white boy speaks truth, and therefore
he shall live, but he must join us. He must
live with us, hunt with us, and fight for us."</p>

<p>"You want me to become an Indian!"
ejaculated Tom.</p>

<p>"We will take you in place of the warrior
that is gone," said the interpreter.</p>

<p>Tom looked thoughtful. He did not enjoy
the prospect before him, but it was, at all
events, better than death. While there was
life there was hope of escape. He concluded
to make one appeal for freedom, and, if that
was denied, to accept the proposal.</p>

<p>"I have a father and mother far away," he
said; "I have brothers and a sister, who will
mourn for me. My father is poor; he needs
my help. Let me go back to them."</p>

<p>The interpreter communicated Tom's words
to his companions, but it was easy to see that
they were not favorably received. The original
advocates of the death penalty looked at
our hero with hostile eyes, and he saw that he
had made a mistake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"The white boy must become one of us; he
must take our brother's place, or he must
die," said the interpreter.</p>

<p>Tom very sensibly concluded that it would
be better to live with the Indians than to be
killed, and signified his acceptance of the offer.
Upon this the Indians formed a circle about
him, and broke into a monotonous chant, accompanied
with sundry movements of the
limbs, which appeared to be their way of welcoming
him into their tribe.</p>

<p>It seemed like a dream to Tom. He found it
very hard to realize his position, so unexpectedly
had he been placed in it. He could
not help wondering what the family at home
would say when they should learn that he had
joined an Indian tribe far beyond the Mississippi.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h3>TOM GIVES A MAGICAL SOIREE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> had no intention of passing his life
with the Indians. In joining them he submitted
to necessity. It gave him a respite, and a
chance to devise plans of escape. He understood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
very well that, if he made the attempt
and failed, his life would be the forfeit. But
Tom determined to take the risk, though his
life was sweet to him; but, of course, he must
wait for a favorable opportunity.</p>

<p>There was a chance of his being rescued by
his party, but this chance was diminished by
the decision of his Indian captors to break
camp, and proceed in a northerly direction,
while the course of the emigrant train was, of
course, westward. Little time was wasted.
The Indians mounted their horses, Tom being
put on the horse of the fallen brave. The
leader put himself at the head, and Tom was
placed in the center, surrounded by Indians.
It was evident that they were not willing to
trust him yet. They meant to afford him no
chance of escape.</p>

<p>As the only one of the band with whom Tom
could converse was the interpreter, who rode
at the head with the chief, he rode in silence.
The Indians on either side of him never turned
their heads toward him, but, grave and impassive,
rode on, looking straight before them.</p>

<p>"This is easier than walking," thought
Tom; "but I would a hundred times rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
walk with Scott, or Miles, than ride in my
present company."</p>

<p>They rode for three hours, and then dismounted
for the midday rest.</p>

<p>Nothing had been seen or heard of his old
friends, and that made Tom anxious and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>"They have gone on without me, leaving me
to my fate," he said to himself, and the reflection
gave him a pang. He had been on such
pleasant and friendly terms with the whole
party, that this cold desertion&mdash;as it appeared&mdash;wounded
him. The young are more sensitive
in such cases than their elders. As we grow
older we cease to expect too much of those
whose interests differ from our own.</p>

<p>Tom felt that his fate was more and more
bound up with the Indians. If some days
should pass before he could escape, he would
find himself in an embarrassing condition.
Suppose he got away safely, he would find himself
in a pathless plain, without provisions,
and with no other guide than the sun. If he
should meet with no party, he would die of
starvation. The prospect seemed by no means
bright.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>I am bound to say that, for a time, Tom, in
spite of his bright, sanguine temperament,
was greatly depressed; but his spirits were
elastic.</p>

<p>"I won't give up to despair," he said to himself.
"Something tells me that I shall come
out right. I must wait and watch my
chances."</p>

<p>Upon this his face brightened, and his air,
which had been listless, became more animated.
The Indians glanced at him, with grave approval.
They concluded that he was becoming
reconciled to living among them.</p>

<p>When the simple midday meal was placed
upon the ground, and the Indians gathered
around it in a sitting posture, Tom followed
their example, and did full justice to the dinner.
In fact, he had taken so much exercise
that he felt hungry. Besides, he knew that he
must keep up his strength, if he wished to escape;
so, instead of keeping aloof in sullen dissatisfaction,
he displayed a "healthy appetite."</p>

<p>After resting several hours the Indians resumed
their journey, but did not travel far.
They were in no hurry. They had no long
journey to make across the continent. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
only wished to go far enough to be safe from
attack by a rescuing party of Tom's friends.
Again they encamped, and this time, from the
preparations made, he understood that it was
for the night.</p>

<p>One thing Tom could not help noticing&mdash;the
silence of these red children of the plains.
They seemed to make no conversation with
each other, except on necessary matters, and
then their words were few in number, replies
being often made in a monosyllable.</p>

<p>"They don't seem very social," thought
Tom. "I suppose they have nothing to talk
about. I wonder if the squaws ever have sewing-circles.
If they have, they can't be much
like Yankee women if they don't find plenty
to talk about."</p>

<p>The silence became oppressive. Tom would
have liked to take a walk, but he knew that
this would not be allowed. It would be
thought that he wanted to escape. Yet to sit
mute hour after hour seemed to Tom intolerably
stupid. A bold idea came to him. He
would try to afford them some amusement.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he said to the interpreter:
"Shall I show you a trick?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The interpreter communicated the proposal
to his comrades, and permission was granted.</p>

<p>Tom took from his pocket a penny. He explained
to the interpreter that he would swallow
the penny, and make it come out at his
nose&mdash;a common boy's trick. The Indians, to
whom this also was communicated, looked
curious and incredulous, and Tom proceeded.</p>

<p>Now, I am not going to explain how Tom
accomplished the illusion. That I leave to the
ingenuity of my boy readers to discover. It is
enough to say that he succeeded, to the great
amazement of his copper-colored spectators.
There was a chorus of ughs! and Tom was requested
to repeat the trick.</p>

<p>He did so, the Indians being as puzzled as
before.</p>

<p>Now, Indians are, in many respects, like
children. They displayed, on this occasion, a
childish curiosity and wonder that amused
Tom. They insisted on his opening his month,
to ascertain whether there was any hidden
avenue from his mouth to his nose, and found,
to their surprise, that his mouth was like their
own. Then one of the Indians volunteered to
try the experiment, and nearly choked himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
with the penny, which, it must be remembered,
was one of the large, old-fashioned, copper
coins, in circulation before the war. It cannot
be said that he turned black in the face,
but he certainly gasped, and rolled his eyes
in a manner that alarmed his friends, and
they instinctively looked to Tom for help.
Tom was equal to the emergency. He rose
hastily, slapped the Indian forcibly on the
back, and the cent was ejected from his mouth.</p>

<p>There was another chorus of ughs! and it
was evident that Tom had risen vastly in their
opinion. They looked upon him as a white
magician, and even were a little afraid that
he might work them injury in some way. But
Tom's frank, good-humored manner reassured
them. They asked him, through the interpreter,
if he could perform any other tricks.
Tom knew a few, that he had learned out of an
old tattered book which had fallen in his way
at home; and such as he had facilities for he
attempted, to the great delight of his new
friends. Tom was becoming popular; and
even those who had at first recommended death
were glad that his life had been spared.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<h3>TOM'S ESCAPE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Night</span> came, and the Indian camp was
hushed and still. It was long before Tom went
to sleep. Generally he was a good sleeper, but
his mind at present was too active for slumber.
"How long is this strange life going to
last?" he asked himself. "How long am I to
be exiled from civilization?" This was more
easily asked than answered.</p>

<p>When he slept, his sleep was troubled. He
dreamed that Lawrence Peabody was a captive,
and that the chief was about to scalp
him, when suddenly he awoke. He could not
at first tell where he was, but a glance revealed
the disheartening truth.</p>

<p>He must have slept several hours, for the
gray dawn was creeping up the sky, heralding
sunrise. He leaned on his elbow, and bent a
searching glance upon his companions. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
were stretched motionless upon the ground,
hushed in the insensibility of sleep. "Are
they asleep?" Tom asked himself. He satisfied
himself that the slumber was genuine, and
there sprang up in his heart the wild hope of
escape. A few rods distant the horses were
fastened. Could he unfasten and mount one
before any of them a wakened?</p>

<p>Tom's heart beat quick with excitement.
He knew that he ran a fearful risk; but he
made up his mind that now was his time.</p>

<p>Slowly, and without noise, he raised himself
to his feet. As he stood erect, he closely
scanned the sleepers. There was not a motion.
With stealthy steps he crept to the horses.
He selected the one he had ridden the day before,
and unloosed him. The animal gave a
slight whinny, and Tom's heart was in his
throat. But no one stirred. He quickly
mounted the animal, and walked him for a few
rods, then gave him a loose rein, and was
soon speeding away. Just then the sun rose,
and this guided him in the direction he was
to take.</p>

<p>He had got a mile away, when, looking back
through the clear air, he saw, to his dismay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
that his flight had been discovered. The Indians
were mounting their horses.</p>

<p>"I must gallop for life," thought Tom.
"They will kill me if they catch me."</p>

<p>He urged on his horse by all the means in
his power. Luckily it was one of the two
fleetest horses the Indians possessed, the other
being ridden by their leader.</p>

<p>Tom's hope was sustained by this fact, which
he had proof of the day before.</p>

<p>Rather to his surprise, he did not feel as
much frightened as he anticipated. He felt
excited, and this was his prominent feeling.
Probably he felt like a soldier in the heat of
battle.</p>

<p>But the odds against Tom were terrible, and
his chance of escape seemed very slender. Behind
him was a band of savages, accustomed to
the plains, strong, wily, enduring, and persistent.
He was new to the plains, and a mere
boy. Moreover, he did not know where to find
his party. There were no sign-boards upon the
prairies, but a vast, uniform expanse stretching
farther than the eye could reach.</p>

<p>Inch by inch, foot by foot, the Indians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
gained upon him, the leader considerably in
advance.</p>

<p>Even if he alone were to overtake Tom, our
hero would of course be no match for a strong,
full-grown warrior, more especially as he had
no weapon with him. By some mischance he
had left it in the camp.</p>

<p>Tom's heart began to fail him. His horse
could not always, perhaps not long, keep up
his headlong speed. Then would follow capture,
and a painful death.</p>

<p>"It's hard," thought Tom sadly; "hard for
me and for my dear parents and brothers and
sisters. Why did I ever leave home?"</p>

<p>He turned in the saddle, and saw the Indian
leader, evidently nearer. But he saw something
else. He saw a herd of buffaloes, thousands
in number, impetuously rushing across
the plain from the west. Their speed was
great. They seemed to be blindly following
their leader.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" ejaculated Tom, in great
excitement; "the Indians are in their path.
If the herd does not stop, they will be destroyed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indians were fully aware of their great
danger. They knew the plains well, and the
terrible, resistless power of these wild herds
when once on the march. They no longer
thought of Tom, but of their own safety. But
the buffaloes were close at hand. They were
sweeping on like a whirlwind. The Indians
could only ride on, and trust to clear them.
But their pathway was wide. It reached to
within a furlong of where Tom was riding.
They never paused; some of the animals in
the advance might have veered to the right or
left on seeing the Indians, but the pressure
from behind prevented. The savages saw their
fate, and it inspired them with more dread
than an encounter with white foes. Finally,
they halted in despair, and their fate overtook
them. Riders and steeds were overthrown as
by a flash of lightning. The dark, shaggy herd
did not stop, but dashed on. Tom, in awe and
excitement, halted his horse, and watched the
terrible sight. He could not but sympathize
with his late companions, though he knew they
would have taken his life.</p>

<p>The buffaloes passed on, but left no life behind
them. The Indians and their horses were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
all trampled to death. Tom was alone upon
the plains.</p>

<p>He thanked God in his heart for his self-deliverance;
though he shuddered at the manner
in which it was wrought. He, too, had
been near being overwhelmed, but, through
God's mercy, had escaped.</p>

<p>But for what had he escaped? Unless he
found his own party, or some other, he would
starve to death, or might fall into the power
of some other tribe of Indians. He must ride
on.</p>

<p>An hour later he thought he saw in the distance
a solitary horseman. It might be an
Indian; but that was not likely, for they generally
traveled in numbers. It was more likely
to be a white man. Any white man would be
a friend, and could guide him to safety, unless
he were himself lost. At any rate, there
seemed but one course to follow, and that to
ride toward the stranger.</p>

<p>When Tom drew near his heart was filled
with sudden joy, for, in the new arrival, he
recognized John Miles. Miles was no less delighted.</p>

<p>"Tom, old boy," he said, "is it you? How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
did you get away? I was afraid we should
never see you again."</p>

<p>"I feared so myself," said Tom; "but I
have been saved in a wonderful manner. Has
the train moved on?"</p>

<p>"Do you think we would go on without you?
Not a man was willing to stir till you were
found. Even Peabody, though afraid of falling
into the hands of the Indians, and losing
his scalp, was in favor of our waiting. The
boys are very anxious about you."</p>

<p>Tom heard this with satisfaction. The esteem
of our friends and associates is dear to
us all; and it is always sad to think that we
may be forgotten in absence.</p>

<p>"But you have not told me of your escape,
Tom," said Miles. "Where are the Indians
who captured you?"</p>

<p>"All dead!" answered Tom solemnly.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! You don't mean to
say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I killed them? Oh, no! Look over
there! Can you see anything?"</p>

<p>Miles looked earnestly.</p>

<p>"I think I see upon the ground some men
and horses."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is the Indians. They were pursuing me
when they were trampled to death by a herd of
buffaloes."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" ejaculated Miles. "I have
heard of such things, but hardly believed in
them."</p>

<p>"It was a terrible sight," said Tom soberly.
"I wish I could have been saved in some
other way."</p>

<p>"It was you or they," said Miles sententiously.
"It is well as it is."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>They were warmly welcomed at the camp.
Tom was looked upon as one raised from the
dead; and the particulars of his wonderful
escape were called for again and again.</p>

<p>"You are sure they didn't scalp you, Tom?"
asked Mr. Peabody.</p>

<p>"Feel and see, Mr. Peabody," said Tom,
smiling. "I believe my hair is pretty firm."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have been in your shoes for all
the gold in California," said Peabody fervently.</p>

<p>"I believe you, Mr. Peabody. Indeed, I
think I may say that I wouldn't be placed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the same situation again for all the gold in
the world."</p>

<p>"Tom," said Scott, "you are bound to succeed."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"You have shown so much pluck and coolness
that you are sure to get along."</p>

<p>"I hope so, I am sure, for my father's sake."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Some weeks later a wagon-train was seen
slowly climbing a mountain pass on the crest
of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. They
reached the summit, and, looking eagerly to
the westward, saw the land of gold at their
feet. They had been months in reaching it.
Now it lay spread before them, glorious in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>"Yonder lies the promised land, my lad,"
said Ferguson. "It remains to be seen
whether we shall be rewarded for our long and
toilsome journey."</p>

<p>"If hard work will win success, I mean to
succeed," said Tom stoutly.</p>

<p>"I don't see any gold," said Lawrence Peabody,
with a disappointed air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you think it grew on trees, Mr. Peabody?"
asked Scott sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I should like to stop a week at a first-class
hotel before getting to work," remarked Peabody.
"I don't like roughing it."</p>

<p>"We will leave you at the first hotel of that
sort we meet. Now, boys, gather about me,
and give three rousing cheers for California."</p>

<p>Thus spoke Miles, and swung his hat. The
cheers were given with a will, and the wagon-train
commenced the descent.</p>
